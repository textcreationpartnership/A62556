            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>F Hereſie could ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve been brought to a ſtand in its owne opinions, it would long ſince have been ſunke in the opinion of all; but finding it ſelfe upon quick ſand, it is forced to change foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and not to ſtay long upon the ſame ground, for fear of ſinking under ground, and falling from its preſent ſtate of <hi>impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>babilitie,</hi> to its ancient ſtate of <hi>inviſibilitie.</hi> And albeit by this often ſhifting, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares to be brought to deſperate ſhifts, yet is it content rather to appeare any thing, then utterly diſappeare into its owne nothing. A <hi>Cheate</hi> muſt often chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge his diſguiſe, a <hi>Mountebank</hi> his market, a <hi>Sophiſter</hi> his <hi>Medium,</hi> and an Army of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated diſordered Troopes, can not long with ſecuritie keepe the ſame place, and poſture. It is not ſo hard to rout them, as
<pb facs="tcp:106315:3"/>to find them out: ſo unarmed, unforti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, ſo disbanded, and ſcattered they are, for want of a Commander in chiefe, that they are no ſooner in ſight, then put to flight, and forced to retreate to ſome new paſſage of leſſe perill.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Scripture alone was thought a ſufficient defence, but finding it failed them, they found it neceſſary to change, and even cut off ſome parts of this forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, which were of advantage to their enemies. After, an outwork of <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition</hi> was judged expedient for more ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curitie; although in effect nothing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves of more danger unto them. Biſhops, and Prieſts formerly caſt out, as of more expences then profit, were ſoone called back, and deſired to appeare armed with true Orders, received not by extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary vocation, but by legall ſucceſſion. Faith alone was thought armour of proofe, before they had found by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience the need of good workes. The Church which in the beginning they ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve out for loſt, and utterly periſhed for many ages, they came at length to ſeeke out with more ſolicitude then ſucceſſe; being reſolved not to find it in that place in which alone it is to be found: and now they ſeeme willing to open the doores of the Church to all Chriſtians, that they
<pb facs="tcp:106315:3"/>in the croud may get in with the reſt. The pretended clearneſſe of Scripture in it ſelfe, or at leaſt as ſubſigned with the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of the private ſpirit, made the definitions of Councells ſeeme of no uſe; now upon better conſideration, fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeing the prejudice they doe to their cauſe, by appealing from the verdict of all Councells in generall, they thinke ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient to admit of ſome in particular, but namely ſuch as treated of matters not apertaining to our preſent controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies: by which evaſion they engage themſelves in greater difficulties, then thoſe they pretended to avoyde; for no juſt exception was, or can be alleadged againſt the Councell of <hi>Lateran</hi> deciding the queſtion of <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> which may not be urged againſt thoſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cells which obliged all Chriſtians to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the myſteries of the <hi>Trinity,</hi> and <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They have been ſo beaten from place to place, and ſo battered, and broken in every place they undertooke to maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne, that divers of the beſt underſtanding, and leaſt paſſion, would be glad to capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulate, and come to an accommodation with us, as farre as it may ſtand with their honour, and intereſt. They are content to wave that maine article of the
<pb facs="tcp:106315:4"/>
               <hi>Popes</hi> Antichriſtian tyranny, and yeeld him a <hi>preeminencie</hi> in ſtead of a <hi>ſupremacie.</hi> The reſpect we give <hi>Images</hi> moſt will free from the ſinne, and many from the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of <hi>Idolatrie,</hi> ſo it may be left as a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of ſuperfluitie: in which rank they will place our prayers to Saints, without imputing hereafter unto us any injury done to Chriſts mercies, or merits. Upon the ſcore of <hi>Tradition</hi> they will graunt us prayer for the dead, provided we leave it to their private intention, whether it be to diminiſh their paines, or increaſe their glory. As to the <hi>reall preſence,</hi> ſo much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted againſt by their Predeceſſors, they refuſe not to accept of, upon condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion they may ſhape Chriſts power, and words, to the narrow model of their own ſenſes, and be exempted from the labour of ſearching ſo farre into <hi>Metaphyſick</hi> (a ſcience not ſutable to the groſſer hereſies of this age) as to finde a diſtinction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the <hi>appearance,</hi> and <hi>ſubſtance</hi> of bread. Notwithſtanding their want of ſpecula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the <hi>Theoriques,</hi> they might in this myſtery, as well as in that of the <hi>Trinitie,</hi> have learned this practicall morall Leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that <hi>Reaſon is never more reaſonable, then when it leaves reaſoning in things above reaſon. Auricular Confeſsion</hi> heretofore traduced for a torture of Conſciences, and Tyranny of
<pb facs="tcp:106315:4"/>the Clergy, many confeſſe to be of good uſe, but few of neceſſity; and none can be brought to deſcend to particulars, for want of <hi>humility</hi> in themſelves, and for want of <hi>ſecrecy</hi> in their Miniſters. Reaſon of ſtate will make them ſubſcribe to the article of Biſhops, that the Prince may have ſo many Peeres of his owne crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and at his owne devotion; and a chaine of conſequence drawes after them, <hi>Prieſts,</hi> and <hi>Deacons;</hi> for, to ſay the truth, their winking ſo long at the cleare ſignes of their Biſhops invalid Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is a ſhrewd ſigne of their looking more upon their Votes in <hi>Parliament,</hi> then their functions in the Church.</p>
            <p>They are willing to fall thus farre, and yet further, from their ancient <hi>Tenets,</hi> with hopes to be admitted as part of our Church, and cleared of the reproachfull name of <hi>Hereticks,</hi> as not diſſenting in the <hi>fundamentall</hi> points of Catholick Faith. But whileſt they talke of <hi>fundamentalls,</hi> they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver paſſe the meere <hi>ſuperficialls,</hi> and they are farre from digging <hi>ſo deepe</hi> as to come to the maine foundation of Faith. It is in vaine to decide fundamentall matters be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we reſolve upon the fundamentall motive of Chriſtian beliefe. No man calls in queſtion the truth of Gods Word, but the queſtion is about the ſufficient propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall
<pb facs="tcp:106315:5"/>of it. That is a fundamentall article of Faith, and undeniable under paine of damnation, which is ſufficiently propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed as revealed by God: we relying upon the infallible and unchangeable Truth of the Churches propoſall, remayne ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in the ſame Tenets, notwithſtanding the oppoſition of <hi>Luther, Calvin,</hi> and other Sectaries; whileſt they on the contrary, accepting Gods Word upon the propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall of private inſpiration, or human per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſion, neither agree with us, nor with one another, nor even with themſelves in different times. As to our new Engliſh Religion, it is very remarkable, how the pretended ſupernaturall inſpiration, and naturall perſuaſion, hath beene alwayes flexible to temporall reſpects. Firſt they were inſpired, and perſuaded to pull downe <hi>Monkes,</hi> and cry downe the <hi>Pope,</hi> and proceed no further, this being ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to comply with King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighths lewdneſſe and coveteouſneſſe. After, they went on as farre as they were led by the intereſt of the Protector <hi>Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour.</hi> But when Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> illegiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy made the Popes authority be jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged wholy inconſiſtent with her ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie; then was it time to make him <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt,</hi> and to purſue his party with fire and ſword. The title of the enſuing Kings
<pb facs="tcp:106315:5"/>not being queſtioned by the <hi>Pope,</hi> made him an object of leſſe hate, and his adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents ſubject to leſſe crueltie, and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion was faſhioned to the humor of the Prince, yet with ſome regard to popular faction. Laſtly the liberty of warre giving licence to thoſe infinite Sects (which lay lurking in every corner of the Engliſh Church) to ſally forth, and to appeare to the world in their different colours, every one tooke notice, how few were groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded on thoſe Tenets, whereon the Church of England is built; and how by leaving the true propoſall of Gods Word, and the ancient rule of Divine Faith, men come to be ſo unſetled in all points of Faith, that their Religion is as changeable as private fancies, and publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke factions. And that all may ſee, how the curſe of <hi>Cain,</hi> the firſt father of Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, as being the firſt oppoſer of Gods true Worſhip, is fallen by inheritance upon our Engliſh Proteſtants, their laſt change is to turne into <hi>Quakers,</hi> whoſe Sect is nothing elſe but <hi>Proteſtancy fallen in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Paulſcy, and inclining to a ſuddaine Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               <p n="13">13 Notwithſtanding it was the Queenes temporall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt to pull downe Catholick Religion in England, yet it was much for her quiet, and peace of the Realme, to keepe alwayes a reſemblance of it in the Clergy, as the beſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy againſt <hi>Puritaniſme,</hi> which was thought by Her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtie dangerous to Monarchy.

               <p>Though the titles of the Catholick Clergy were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed upon perſons who favoured the new Religion, yet the Ordination was not; becauſe that which was inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by <hi>Edward</hi> the VI. was judged invalid by all Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks, and ſo declared by publick judgement in Queene <hi>Marys</hi> reigne; in ſo much, that leaſes made by King <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dwards</hi> Biſhops, though confirmed by the Deane, and Chapter,

               <p n="25">25 The true reaſon why the Engliſh forme of making Prieſts, and Biſhops, is ſo notoriouſly deficient, and inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid, is, becauſe it was made in King <hi>Edward</hi> the VI. his ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me, when Zuinglianiſme, and Puritans did prevaile in the Engliſh Church; the reall preſence was not believed by them of the Clergy who bore ſway, therefore they did not put in the forme of Prieſthood any word expreſſing authority, and power to make <hi>Chriſts</hi> Body preſent. They held Epiſcopacy, and Prieſthood to be one, and the ſame thing; therefore in the forme of making Biſhops, they put not one word epreſſing Epiſcopall function, onely ſome generall termes that might ſeeme ſufficient to give them authority to enjoy the temporalities and Biſhop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricks. This is alſo the true reaſon why <hi>Parker,</hi> and his Collegues were content with the Nags-head conſecration, and why others recurred to extraordinary vocation in Queene <hi>Elizabeths</hi> time. Its very credible, that if Maſter <hi>Laud</hi> had found ſucceſſe in his firſt attempts, he would in time reforme the forme of the Engliſh Ordination, and thruſt in ſome words expreſſing the power of Prieſts, and Biſhops; ſeeing he, and others of the Proteſtant Clergy of late,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Kallend. an.</hi> 3. <hi>Ed. Vl. c.</hi> 12. <hi>Maſon pag.</hi> 94.</note> did differ ſo much in opinion concerning Prieſthood, and Epiſcopacy, from thoſe who lived in King <hi>Edward</hi> the VI. time, and in the beginning of Queene <hi>Elizabeths</hi> reig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne. He could not miſſe with ſix Prelats, and ſix other men learned in Gods Law, whereof the greater number might deviſe as warrantable a forme of making Biſhops, and Prieſts, as was deviſed by the ſame number in King <hi>Edwards</hi> time. Yet all had beene in vaine, becauſe neither Maſter <hi>Laud</hi> himſelfe, nor any of the reſt then living, could conſecrate others, even with the Catholick forme, ſeeing none of them all had valid Ordination, as hath beene demonſtrated. Therefore it was thought expedient
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:106315:19"/>to cover the want of the reality of true Ordination, with an exterior formality of long cloakes, and ſurpliſes, and ſupply the want of Sacrifice with croſſes, and candleſticks upon the Altars.</p>
               <p n="26">26 Maſter <hi>Maſon</hi> commends much <hi>the wiſdome of the Engliſh Church that ſo diſcreetly, and religiouſly pared away all ſuperfluous Ceremonies in Ordination:</hi> and ſaith, it was <hi>a ſingular priviledge of Maſter</hi> Parker, <hi>that being the</hi> 70. <hi>Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop after Saint</hi> Auſtin <hi>the Apoſtle of England, yet of all that number he was the onely man that received Conſecration with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Popes Bulls, and ſuperfluous Aaronicall ornaments.</hi> How diſcreet, and religious the Engliſh Church was in paring away pretended ſuperfluities in Ordination, can not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined by Maſter <hi>Maſon,</hi> untill he makes appeare that all is ſuperfluous in that kinde which he, and the Puritans, who made the Engliſh Rituall in King <hi>Edward</hi> the VI. ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me, fancied ſuperfluous. It is not the part of any particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Church to pare away any thing that hath beene delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to them by antiquity to be obſerved. Though ſome words have beene added to ancient formes of Ordination, for their greater explanation, or ſolemnity, yet none were ever ſo raſh, as to pare away any, eſpecially thoſe that ſeemed to ſignifie the power, and authority intended by the Ordainer.</p>
               <p n="27">27 To conclude this matter, I ſay with Saint <hi>Ierome: Eccleſia non eſt quae non habet Sacerdotem.</hi> How can the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Church be the true Church, ſeeing it hath not any one Prieſt, or Biſhop? Though it were not evident that it hath no valid Ordination, yet ſo many manifeſt uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainties, and doubts, as themſelves muſt acknowledge con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning their Ordination, doth demonſtrate the nullitie of their Church. For if there remaine but one ſolid, and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent doubt of the validity of Ordination of any Church, its impoſſible it ſhould be the true Catholick, and Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick: becauſe a doubtfull Clergy makes a doubtfull Church; and a doubtfull Church is no Church. The firſt ſtep to Chriſtian, and Catholick beliefe, is the well groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded credibility, excluding all prudent doubts, of that Church whereof we are members; if we have any pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent ground to doubt of the Clergy, we have the ſame to doubt of our Church, and of the Faith, or Doctrine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by its teſtimony: and the true Faith admits of no
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:106315:20"/>ſuch doubts. Therefore Proteſtants before they can pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently believe to have true Faith, or be in the Catholick, muſt cleare all the doubts heretofore objected againſt their Ordination, which I will briefly ſumme up.</p>
               <p n="28">28 Firſt they muſt prove clearly, that the ſtory of the <hi>Nags-head</hi> was a fable, and conſequently that Maſter <hi>Neale,</hi> and the other Catholicks, who ſaid they were eye-witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of what paſſed, were impudent Impoſtors, and content to be convicted as ſuch in the ſame place, and time that they invented ſo palpable a lye. Secondly, they muſt make appeare evidently, that all the Catholicks of that time, both Biſhops, Prieſts, and others, who believed Maſter <hi>Neale,</hi> and ſuffered much for conſcience, were all runne mad, becauſe they believed ſo great a foppery; or if they did not believe him, they were moſt wicked, and ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legeous perſons, to engage poſterity by their relation and teſtimony, to reordaine the Proteſtant Clergy. Thirdly, they muſt demonſtrate, that all the firſt Proteſtant Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, and others conſecrated by them, did conſpire, not to contradict the ſtory of the <hi>Nags-head,</hi> and their owne invalid conſecration, for the ſpace of fifty and odde yea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, to the great diſcredit of themſelves, and their whole Church: where as they might eaſily ſtop their adverſaries mouths, by producing witneſſes, and Records of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended ſolemne Congregation at Lambeth, being ſo often demanded in printed Bookes, by whom, and how were they ordained? Fourthly, it muſt be made appeare to the world, that <hi>Bancroft</hi> Biſhop of London, could be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the publick Regiſters of <hi>Parkers</hi> Ordination at Lambeth, himſelfe being ſo much concerned in it, and in the knowledge of it: if he were not ignorant of the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blick Regiſters, why did he anſwer ſo fondly, and contrary to the very Proteſtant principles, that a Prieſt might or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine Biſhops in caſe of neceſſity? Fifthly, it muſt be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly proved, that not onely <hi>Bancroft</hi> was ignorant of the publick Regiſters, but that all the Biſhops of England, who were preſent in the late Parliament, knew nothing of them; whereas Doctor <hi>Morton</hi> pretended Biſhop of <hi>Dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> affirmed publikely in the upper Houſe, that the firſt Proteſtant Biſhops were conſecrated at the <hi>Nags-head.</hi> This anſwer all the reſt approved by their ſilence, and were glad to have that retiring place againſt the Presbyterians,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:106315:20"/>who proved clearly, that they were not conſecrated at Lambeth, as Maſter <hi>Maſen</hi> pretends. But if Doctor <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> and the reſt of the Biſhops knew any thing of <hi>Maſons</hi> Booke, and Regiſters, as infallibly they did, why did not they ſtick to that? This proves evidently, that none of them did give credit to <hi>Maſons</hi> new found Regiſters.</p>
               <p n="29">29 Sixthly, ſuppoſing Maſter <hi>Maſons</hi> forged Records were true, it muſt be made cleare that there was in their Ordination a competent number of true Biſhops, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently that the Biſhops of <hi>Edward</hi> the VI. were validly conſecrated, notwithſtanding the Declaration of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary by publick Acts, and ſentences in Queene <hi>Maryes</hi> reigne. Seventhly, if there was not a competent number of true Biſhops, whether in the beginning of Queene <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeths</hi> reigne there, as any ſuch neceſſity as Proteſtants pretended, having then in England 14. Catholick and true Biſhops. Eighthly, it muſt be made appeare that <hi>Barlowe</hi> was conſecrated, who was the principall Conſecrator of <hi>Parker,</hi> for if he were, how is it poſſible that in all the Regiſters of England, and Wales, there ſhould be no men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Conſecration? Laſtly, it muſt be proved clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that the forme uſed in the ordaining of Proteſtant Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, and Biſhops, is valid. It will be a very hard taske to cleare all theſe doubts, and exceptions How unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately was <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt, late King of England, miſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in matter of his Biſhops, and Clergy. What ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple could he have had, if he had knowne the truth, to give way to the <hi>Parliament,</hi> to pull downe <hi>Parliament Biſhops;</hi> who were ſo farre from being <hi>de Iure Divino,</hi> that they were not ſo much as <hi>de Iure Eccleſiaſtico.</hi>
               </p>

But though any perſon ſhould not be convinced of the nullitie of their Ordination, he can not but harbour a prudent doubt thereof, there being ſo evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent reaſons, and motives for it, as have beene ſet downe in this Chapter.

<pb n="29" facs="tcp:106315:22"/>to be Divine Revelation, and their teſtimony be confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by miracles, all men are bound to believe that the ſaid Doctrine was revealed by God. This is the reaſon why the perfidious Jewes did ſinne grievouſly in not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving the Doctrine of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> being confirmed with ſo many evident miracles. It is not neceſſary every perſon ſee a miracle, that the true Faith, and Doctrine of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church be ſufficiently propoſed to him as Divine Revelation; its enough that he can not prudently deny, or doubt, that miracles have beene wrought in confirmation of the Doctrine propoſed. <hi>Chriſts</hi> Doctrine was ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently propoſed as Divine to many Jewes, who were not preſent at his miracles; its enough they were credibly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported. Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> proved that miracles were wrought in confirmation of Chriſtian Religion by this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious <hi>Dilemma.</hi> Either the world believing ſuch ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge, and improbable things (to human ſenſe) as our Faith teacheth; and ſo contrary to our naturall inclinations; did ſee them confirmed by miracles, or no. If they did ſee mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, we have our intent. If they did believe without ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any miracle, we have our intent alſo; becauſe that very beliefe is the greateſt of all miracles: for how is it poſſible that ſober, and wiſe men ſhould be ſo mad, as to believe, and embrace a new and ſtrange Doctrine, ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to their ſenſes, and contrary to their liberty, and naturall inclinations, if they had not beene wrought upon by ſome ſupernaturall power, and ſignes? In one word therefore we may conclude, that onely Faith, or Doctrine is ſufficiently propoſed as Divine Revelation, which is not onely propoſed as ſuch by the teſtimony of a Church, but of ſuch a Church whoſe teſtimony hath beene con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by unqueſtionable miracles, either ſeen by the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever, or at leaſt ſo credibly reported to him by the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of honeſt, and learned men, that it were want of prudence in any perſon whoſoever, to deny the truth, and ſufficiency of ſuch a teſtimony, and propoſall.</p>

               </head>
               <p n="1">1 THere was never any Heretick ſo madly obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, as to give God the lye to his face, and in plaine termes; all Sectaries acknowledge him to be Truth it ſelfe, and therefore not capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of deceiving, or of being deceived. The obſtinacy of Hereticks is againſt Gods verities, not as they are uttered immediatly by himſelfe, but as they are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by his Church. If God himſelfe were pleaſed to ſpeake immediatly to men, in ſuch a manner, that it were evident, and cleare to them, the words, and ſenſe which the Church propoſeth, were dictated by himſelfe, we ſhould be little troubled with Hereſies, none would be obſtinate All the obſtinacy of Hereticks proceeds from the difficulty they finde in believing that God doth ſpeak, or declare his ſenſe by the Church: this once granted, our underſtanding hath no difficulty to ubmit by an implicite Faith to whatſoever the Church propoſeth as Gods Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, or Word.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Againſt cleare evidence there can be no obſtinacy; the object of it muſt be involved in ſome obſcurity, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the will (which is the ſource of obſtinacy) could not maſter the unſtanding. He who denyes what is cleare, and evident, is more mad, then obſtinate. There is nothing more generally acknowledged, or more cleate, and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to the underſtanding of all Chriſtians, then this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, <hi>If God ſaid, or meant any thing its very true.</hi> The obſtinacy therefore of Hereticks, doth not conteſt with this cleare, and confeſſed truth: it onely doubteth, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyeth, that God ſaid, or meant any ſuch thing as the Church pretends; but no Heretick ever denyed, or doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, but that <hi>if God meant, or ſaid what the Church pretends, it muſt be true.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3 The difference therefore betweene an <hi>Heretick,</hi> and a <hi>Catholick,</hi> is not, that the Heretick denyes, or doubts, all that to be true which he thinks God revealed, or meant; but the difference conſiſts in this, that the Heretick doth

               <p n="4">4 The obſtinacy of <hi>Hereſie</hi> may be well compared to the obſtinacy of <hi>Rebellion,</hi> Hereſie being indeed a Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion of private, and proper judgement againſt Gods au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and veracity appearing ſufficiently in his Church. Put the caſe that a Province of <hi>Spaine,</hi> or <hi>France</hi> did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject any Lawes, or Ordinances made by their King, and intimated by his Officers to the people, and proclaimed in the ſame Provinces. In caſe theſe Lawes, and the ſaid Officers (who have all the exterior ſignes, or markes whereby the Kings authority is uſually diſcerned) were contemned by the people, not becauſe they doubt of their Kings legiflative power, but becauſe they will not belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve he made ſuch Lawes, or gave any ſuch Commiſſion to his Officers; would not the people, notwithſtanding all this pretended ignorance, be Rebells, and obſtinate againſt their Soveraigne? would it excuſe them from the guilt of Rebellion, to alledge in their owne behalfe, that they did not thinke, or believe, the King commanded any ſuch thing, as his Officers pretended, and proclaimed? Their very excuſe involves obſtinacy, and Rebellion. The obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience and duty, which Subjects owe to their King, muſt be extended alſo to his Officers; they muſt obey their Soveraigne, not onely when himſelfe commands, but alſo when the Officers that have the ordinary ſignes of his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, do command in his name.</p>

There are but two wayes to convince the underſtanding of man; the one is evident, and cleare reaſon; the other is autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. To ſome things its neceſſary, even for ſalvation, we give our aſſent, though no evident, and cleare reaſon ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth; authority (that is, the teſtimony of lawfull wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes) muſt be taken for reaſon, and ſupply the want of it. It is unreaſonable, and damnable, not to honour our Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and Parents, though they have no other evidence, or reaſon to ſhew, that they are our lawfull Princes or Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, but the authority, and teſtimony of lawfull witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. God therefore having decreed that men ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve ſome myſteries above reaſon, commanded all, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve under paine of damnation whatſoever the Church ſaith he revealed. It is not unreaſonable that God ſhould condemn us for not believing the teſtimony of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church in matters of Faith, which are above reaſon; ſeeing we ſhall be condemned, if we believe not the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of our Neighbours concerning our Princes, and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents. Is it a lawfull excuſe for any man to ſay, If I had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved ſuch a man to be my Soveraigne, I would obey him; or ſuch a woman to be my Mother, I would honour her? If there be lawfull witneſſes for Prince, or Parents, their teſtimony is to be believed; the very not believing them is a crime, though there be no more evidence for it, then the ſaid teſtimony. Therefore <hi>à fortiori,</hi> the not believing the teſtimony of the Church, confirmed with ſo many ſignes, in matters of Faith, is a crime, and obſtinate he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie.</p>

My proofe is this: The teſtimony of the Catholick Church, concerning what is pretended to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed, or not revealed by God, muſt oblige all perſons who are informed of it, to believe what it ſaith, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth. But if all Chriſtians, or any two Churches not agreeing in their teſtimonies (ſuppoſe Roman Catholicks, and Proteſtants) be parts of the Catholick Church, the teſtimony thereof can not oblige any ſober perſon to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve what both ſay, and propoſe.

Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall articles may be called ſuch as no ignorance of them can excuſe men from damnation, for not being be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved.

               <p n="2">2 But whether theſe articles be both called fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall, or onely the firſt ſort of them, our controverſie with Proteſtants is the ſame, and the queſtion is not ſet here out of its proper place; becauſe the reſolution of it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to anſwer an objection, which Proteſtants make againſt the Doctrine of the former Chapter. All Chriſtians (ſay they) do agree in fundamentall points of Faith, as in the <hi>Trinity, Incarnation, &amp;c.</hi> what great matter is it, if they agree not in other things of little importance, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the knowledge, and ſufficient propoſall whereof, they may be ſaved, as <hi>Purgatory, Tranſubſtantiation, &amp;c?</hi> Why ſhould we be obliged to believe things that are not abſolutely neceſſary for ſalvation? eſpecially ſeeing Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Catholick Divines do not deny, that ignorance of not fundamentalls is not damnable? Therefore all Chriſtians (though diſſenting in not fundamentalls) may be called Catholicks, and the univerſall Church; becauſe they agree in all neceſſary articles of Catholick Religion; and though their teſtimonies do not agree in Purgatory, v.g. being an article of Faith; why ſhould their diſagreement in that petty point invalid their teſtimony concerning the myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the <hi>Trinity, Incarnation,</hi> and other fundamentall ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles.</p>
               <p n="3">3 This diſcourſe, and objection of Proteſtants hath damned many a ſoule, becauſe they did not examine the truth of it as they ought. But to declare the fallacy of it, ſomething muſt be ſaid of the Churches infallibility. Moſt Proteſtants do grant, that the teſtimony of the Church is infallible in propoſing the fundamentall articles of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion; as, in delivering Scripture to be Gods Word, and in declaring the myſtery of the <hi>Trinity &amp;c.</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Chriſtian, and Catholick Faith muſt admit of no doubts concerning the truth of fundamentalls; and if the Church be not infallible in propoſing thoſe to us, we muſt neceſſarily doubt of their truth; for, though we doubt not that whatſoever God ſaid is true, yet we can not but
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:106315:26"/>doubt, whether he revealed or meant any ſuch thing as the myſtery of the <hi>Trinity,</hi> or <hi>Incarnation,</hi> if we do not believe that the Church is infallible in propoſing the ſaid myſtery? God therefore in his Providence can not permit the Church to erre, or deceive us in fundamentalls, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing its neceſſary for our ſalvation not to doubt of the truth of fundamentall myſteries; but if the Church may erre in propoſing them, we can not but doubt of their truth. This reaſon (ſay Proteſtants) can not be applyed to <hi>not fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentalls,</hi> becauſe they are not abſolutely neceſſary for ſalvation; and our ſalvation is the onely motive that God had to make the Church infallible in propoſing articles of Religion. Therefore none is bound to believe, that the Church is infallible in not fundamentalls.</p>
               <p n="4">4 If the onely motive that God had to make the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church infallible, were our ſalvation, this diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe of Proteſtants might have ſome colour of truth; but Gods motive in all his actions, is not onely our ſalvation, but (in firſt place) his owne honour, and glory. There is nothing concerns Gods honour more, then that, whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is ſufficiently propoſed as revealed by him, be credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by us without the leaſt doubt; whether the matter be great, or of little importance. Therefore the Churches infallibility, and our obligation of believing it, ought not to be meaſured by the greatneſſe, importance, or abſolute neceſſity of the matter propoſed, in order onely to our ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; but alſo by the ſufficiency of the propoſall, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to Gods honour, and veracity. If a matter not abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary for ſalvation be as ſufficiently propoſed to be revealed by God, as the myſtery of the <hi>Trinity,</hi> the obligation is as great of believing the one without any doubt, as the other. The reaſon is cleare; becauſe there is as great an injury done to God, by denying, or doubting of his veracity, and revelation, in a ſmall matter, as in a great. In believing we are as much bound to have a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to Gods honour, as to our owne ſalvation; and his honour is as much concerned in being believed without the leaſt doubt concerning <hi>Purgatory,</hi> as concerning the <hi>Trinity,</hi> if both myſteries be equally, or ſufficiently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed as Divine Revelation.</p>
               <p n="5">5 Seeing therefore that the ſelfe ſame Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church, and teſtimony, which propoſed ſufficiently
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:106315:27"/>in the yeare 1516. to <hi>Luther,</hi> and all other Proteſtants ſince that time, Scripture, the myſtery of the Trinity &amp;c. to be Divine Revelation; did in the ſame yeare, and doth now alſo propoſe <hi>Purgatory, Tranſubstantion,</hi> and other points (which Proteſtants call <hi>not fundamentall</hi>) to be revealed by God: its evident that there is as great obligation of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving without any doubt <hi>Purgatory, Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> and others not thought fundamentalls by Proteſtants, as the fundamentalls. But theſe articles which Proteſtants call <hi>not fundamentall,</hi> can not be belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved without ſome doubt, if the Church be not infallible in propoſing them; as they themſelves muſt grant by force of the parity made with their fundamentall articles. Therefore the Catholick Church is as infallible in its teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony concerning not fundamentall articles being Divine Revelation, as it is in fundamentalls; or if not, it muſt be fallible in both.</p>
               <p n="6">6 Yet if matters be well conſidered, we ſhall finde, that its impoſſible to deny any article of Faith, (though not abſolutely neceſſary, and therefore (in the opinion of Proteſtants) of little importance) but a neceſſary and fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall article muſt be denyed together with it. There is no article of Faith more fundamentall, and neceſſary for ſalvation, then <hi>Gods veracity.</hi> They who deny Purgatory, v.g. deny Gods veracity; becauſe they who deny any thing that is ſufficiently propoſed as Divine Revelation, deny Gods veracity, whether the matter propoſed as revealed by him, be great, or ſmall. Neither can Proteſtants give any other reaſon; why by denying the Trinity, Gods vera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city is denyed, but becauſe the Trinity is ſufficiently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed as Divine Revelation. Therefore if Purgatory, or Tranſubſtantiation be as ſufficiently propoſed as the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; by denying them, and others the like, Gods veracity is alſo denyed. So that all articles of Faith, if ſufficiently propoſed, are fundamentall, and neceſſary for ſalvation.</p>
               <p n="7">7 My ſecond anſwer to the diſcourſe, and argument of Proteſtants, is, that witneſſes contradicting themſelves in circumſtances, though of little importance, are not to be prudently credited in the maine points wherein they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree. The teſtimony of the two old Judges was not valid in the crime of adultery objected by them againſt <hi>Suſanna,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Dan.</hi> 13.</note> becauſe though their teſtimonies did agree in the crime,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:106315:27"/>and in what was materiall to condemne her; yet they va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in ſome circumſtances not materiall. What did it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port (as to the guilt of <hi>Suſanna</hi>) whether ſhe committed adultery under a Fig-tree, or a Pine? Though it was a circumſtance very indifferent, and of little importance in it ſelfe, yet the incoherency in it did prove that the two old mens teſtimonies in the maine were invalid. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore although not fundamentall articles were not neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for ſalvation, yet the incoherency in ſuch little matters doth invalid the Catholick Churches teſtimony even in fundamentalls, and the maine points of Chriſtian Religion. Therefore it muſt be granted that the teſtimony of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church either is not prudently credible, and infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible, in neceſſary, and fundamentall articles; or that it is prudently credible, and infallible in not fundamentalls. It followeth alſo out of the premiſes, that the Catholick Church can not be all Churches of Chriſtendome, becauſe there are not two of them whoſe teſtimonies concerning Faith do not differ, at leaſt in not fundamentall points of Religion, and by conſequence the teſtimony is abſolutely incredible, becauſe incoherent.</p>
               <p>Againſt what hitherto hath beene ſaid, ſome may object, that the Fathers unanimouſly teſtifying fundamentall arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles to be revealed by God, ought to be credited, though they contradict one another in matters not fundamentall. Therefore the ſame may be ſaid of many diſſenting Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, or Congregations of Chriſtians; why ſhould not the Catholick Church be compoſed of all Chriſtians agreeing in the principall points of Chriſtian Religion, though they agree not in others of leſſe importance. The example of tke Babylonian Judges in the caſe of <hi>Suſanna,</hi> can not be applyed to the Catholick Church: they were not credited by <hi>Daniel</hi> in the fact which they unanimouſly teſtified, becauſe the circumſtance wherein they varied, was ſo concomitant, and connected with the fact it ſelfe, that it was impoſſible to ſee one, and not the other. The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refore the contradicting themſelves in the circumſtance of the tree, did demonſtrate that they never ſaw <hi>Suſanna</hi> commit adultery. But no ſuch connexion appeares be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene fundamentall, and not fundamentall articles of Chriſtian Religion; the <hi>Trinity,</hi> or <hi>Incarnation</hi> may be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently propoſed as Divine Revelation by the teſtimony
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:106315:28"/>of both Proteſtant, and Roman Church, though <hi>Purgato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> or <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> be onely held by Proteſtants, to be onely a probable opinion of the Roman Clergy, and conſequently not ſufficiently propoſed as Divine Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, becauſe it wants the concurrence of a conſiderable part of Chriſtianity in the teſtimony which it gives of thoſe, and the like not fundamentall Tenets.</p>
               <p>To the firſt part of this argument I ſay, that the Fathers in their greateſt differences agree in ſubmitting their jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gements to the Sea Apoſtolick, or to a generall Councell, as to the viſible and infallible Judge of Controverſies Not to Proteſtant Churches, each one pretending to be Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent of the other, and of the Roman alſo. Such inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendency, and obſtinacy of judgement is wholy inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtent with unity of Faith, and identity of Church.</p>
               <p>Now to the ſecond part concerning <hi>Suſanna,</hi> and the two old Judges, I anſwer, that all myſteries of Chriſtian Religion are connected in the motive of beliefe; ſo that we can no more diſcover a matter of Faith without the motive, then a matter of fact without its circumſtance. Wherefore the motive being the ſame in all, they are all united to the motive, and conſequently ſo inſeparable one from another, that denying one you deny all, as denying the motive, whereon all, and every one do rely.</p>
               <p>If the greatneſſe of the matter propoſed, or the number of proponents, and not the quality of the propoſall, did au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoriſe, and induce the obligation of believing whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Catholick Church teſtifieth to be Divine Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the aforeſaid argument might trouble Catholicks: but ſeeing that both the teſtimony of few, and matters not abſolutely neceſſary for ſalvation, may be confirmed with ſupernaturall ſignes, and with true markes of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church, and Doctrine, there is no neceſſity of obtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding upon it any Proteſtant Congregation, thereby to give more credit. Chriſtians were not very many in the beginning of the primitive times; and yet they filled up the number of the Catholick Church. The Arrians were thought to be more numerous then the Catholicks, and yet it was never thought neceſſary, by any Orthodox, to have the concurrence of their ſuffrage, or teſtimony con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Religion, and declaring what was fundamentall, and not fundamentall. I ſee no reaſon why the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:106315:28"/>Church of this age ſhould court Proteſtants more <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hen the Church of the fourth and fifth age did Arrians, Neſtorians &amp;c. I am ſure the Arrians were more in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber then Proteſtants, and much more learned, they had a more certaine Ordination of Prieſts, and Biſhops, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them were of as good life, and converſation as any Proteſtants are, or were ſince the beginning of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Reformation. Why therefore ſhould Proteſtants be a part of the Catholick Church, and not Arrians, or Neſtorians?</p>
               <p>If Proteſtants be admitted as part of the Catholick Church, the Turkes, Jewes, and all others, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve there is one God, may with reaſon complaine, that they alſo are not looked upon as Catholicks. For they, and we agree in the two fundamentall articles, which onely (according the opinion of many learned Divines) are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, <hi>neceſſitate medij;</hi> to wit, <hi>that there is a God,</hi> and <hi>that he is Remunerator.</hi> Turkes, and Jewes believe this, therefore they agree both with us, and Proteſtants in fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentalls. Let us all therefore be parts of the Catholick Church. And though Jewes, or Turkes be not baptized, that can not prejudice them, according the principles of Proteſtants; their implicit, or conditionall faith will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe them, as well as Proteſtants from damnation, <hi>If God revealed the neceſſity of Baptiſme, or that Scripture is his VVord</hi> (ſaith a Turke) <hi>I believe both,</hi> but untill that be made cleare unto me, I am not more bound to believe either abſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and without doubt, then Proteſtants are to believe <hi>Tranſubſtantiation.</hi> I ſee no reaſon why this implicite, and conditionall faith ſhould not ſave Jewes, and Turkes, as well as Proteſtants, if the myſteries not believed by either, be equally propoſed. Therefore Proteſtants are no more part of the Catholick Church, then Turkes, or Jewes: I am certaine we have no more need of the teſtimony of the one, then of the other, to eſtabliſh what ought to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved as Catholick Faith, or what articles are fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall.</p>

The teſtimony of the true Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church muſt not be credible onely to ſilly ſoules, that believe any thing they heare, by reaſon of their igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, or becauſe they were not rightly informed: it muſt be credible to the moſt prudent, and informed perſons, by reaſon that the ſaid teſtimony is confirmed with ſo cleare ſignes, and markes of Gods providence in planting, and propagating the Faith profeſſed by the true Church, that (all circumſtances conſidered) no informed, and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent perſon may judge any other Church to have as much as a probable appearance of the true one, when they are compared with the Catholick.</p>
               <p n="2">2 How the Proteſtant Churches, and Reformation did beginne, hath beene ſaid in the firſt Chapter; which ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, let us now examine whether any perſon can pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently believe, that either the Proteſtant Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, or that of <hi>Stratzburg,</hi> or <hi>Zurick,</hi> or <hi>Geneva,</hi> be the true Catholick Church of God? The ground of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe of theſe, and all other reformed Churches, are redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to two; one is cleare Scripture pretended againſt the Roman errours, (as they call them;) the other is, the private Spirit, whereby they interpret the true ſenſe of
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:106315:29"/>Scriptures to be contrary to the Tenets, and Doctrine of the Roman Catholick Church. This is all the evidence which Proteſtants have to prove, that each of their owne Congregations is the true <hi>Spouſe</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and that the Church of Rome is the <hi>VVhore</hi> of <hi>Babylon.</hi> Miracles they do not pretend to; and as for the two other ſignes which moſt of their Authors brag of, (that is, the ſincere preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Word of God, and the lawfull adminiſtration of the Sacraments) theſe two can not be knowne, nor per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, untill that, whereupon they depend, be firſt known to be the true ſenſe of Scripture, or the true Faith be knowne. But when the true Faith is knowne, we have no more need of ſignes to bring us to the knowledge of it, or the true Church that profeſſeth it, then a Pilot hath of markes to be guided by into the haven, after he is within ſafe, and at anchor. Therefore theſe two ſignes of Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant are not true ſignes, becauſe they are as unknowne, and as hard to be found out as the Church it ſelfe, which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="3">3 As for the firſt ground of Proteſtancy, and Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which is the pretended clearneſſe of Scripture againſt the Doctrine of the Roman Church; it can as little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme the teſtimony of the Church of England, or <hi>Zurick, &amp;c.</hi> as the Turkes <hi>Alcoran.</hi> Firſt they tell us that Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is againſt <hi>Tranſubſtantiation, Purgatory, worſhip of Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges &amp;c.</hi> We deny it, and bring (at leaſt) as cleare texts of Scripture for our ſelves, as Proteſtants do againſt us. They ſay the words, and ſenſe of Scripture are ſo cleare againſt our Doctrine, that none can deny them. Yet we reply, that we are not ſo impious, nor obſtinate, as to maintaine Doctrine point blank againſt Gods Word, and ſenſe. Now the queſtion is, whether the teſtimony of Proteſtant Churches againſt us, or ours in our owne behalfe, and defence concerning the clearneſſe of Scripture, be moſt credible to ſober, and prudent men? I anſwer that the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of Catholicks of the obſcurity of Scripture, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Tranſubſtantiation, worſhip of Images &amp;c.</hi> is not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly more credible then the teſtimony of Proteſtants to the contrary; but alſo that the teſtimony of Proteſtants, ſaying, that Scripture is cleare againſt <hi>Tranſubſtantion, worſhip of Images, Purgatory &amp;c.</hi> may be demonſtrated to be falſe.</p>

               <p n="5">5 It is impoſſible for men equally learned, and equally honeſt, to have any controverſie about the ſenſe of any words of Scripture, if the ſenſe be cleare, and evident.

The Puritans muſt onely be the Elect, the Saints, and pure Zealots of the beauteous diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline of <hi>Sion:</hi> which to carry on, though whole Nations be extirpated, their holy Spirit doth not onely rid them from any remorſe of conſcience, but aſſures them no worke can be more meritorious. If you inquire of them, how they know whether this ſpirit of theirs be good, or bad, of God, or the Divel? <hi>Calvin</hi> their Patriarch, and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter anſwers, that they do diſcerne it as clearly as they do white from black, ſweet from ſower, and light from dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; his proofe is the experience and teſtimony of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one of the faithfull Brethren, concerning the pureneſſe of his owne ſpirit.</p>
               <p n="2">2 This Calviniſticall and private ſpirit being ſo hidden,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:106315:31"/>and undiſcernable, can not be a ſufficient, and prudent ground (at leaſt for any man that hath it not) to believe it is the Spirit of Truth, and of the Catholick Church. Men who are not in the true Church, muſt be led into it by ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me credit, and exteriour ſignes. And though Faith be a gift of God, yet it is communicated by preaching, and hearing, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. We do not deny that God muſt helpe all Catholicks interiourly with his ſupernaturall grace, and ſpirit; but the difference between the <hi>Puritan,</hi> and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick ſpirit, is, that the Puritan ſpirit inſpireth a beliefe contrary to reaſon; the Catholick ſpirit inſpires a beliefe non contrary, but agreable to reaſon. Though Chriſtian Faith be above reaſon, it is not unreaſonable. But it can not be agreable to reaſon that any perſon believe a Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanicall ſpirit without any more proofe of the goodneſſe of it, then a Puritans word, againſt a ſenſe of Scripture which hath beene continued in the Roman Churches ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce the primitive times, as is evident by tradition, teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of Fathers, and acknowledged by the Magdeburg Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turies, and other Proteſtant Writers. Therefore the private ſpirit can not be a ſufficient propoſall of the true Faith, or a credible, and convincing ſigne of the true Church.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Another proofe that no private ſpirits interpretation of Scripture can be the true one, being contrary to the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blick teſtimony of the Church which went before it, and Puritans pretend to reforme; may be borrowed from Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> who giveth to underſtand,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.20.</note> that no private interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation can be the true ſenſe of Scripture. The reaſon is cleare, becauſe there is none (if not confirmed in grace) who may not be an obſtinate Heretick againſt the true ſenſe of Scripture in controverted texts; but no man can be obſtinate againſt his owne private interpretation, and the ſenſe of his private ſpirit. Therefore he can not be an Heretick, if the private interpretation of Scripture againſt the publick teſtimony of the precedent, or preſent Church which he impugneth, be the true meaning, and ſenſe of Gods Word.</p>
               <p n="4">4 Perhaps Puritans will grant that its impoſſible for any of them to be an Heretick, ſeeing their ſpirit is infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible. If this be granted, its alſo impoſſible for any other to be an Heretick, or obſtinate againſt their ſpirit, or inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation; becauſe he who is obſtinate, may be convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced;
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:106315:32"/>and its not poſſible to convince any man but by cleare reaſon, or at leaſt by lawfull witneſſes. Cleare rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon Puritans can not pretend for their ſpirit, becauſe its a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt reaſon to believe it. Lawfull witneſſes for it there can be none, or no more then one; which is not enough, nor allowed as lawfull in a mans owne caſe. Though eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Puritan giveth not onely a teſtimony of his owne, but alſo of his Brethrens ſpirit, yet he is no lawfull witneſſe for any other mans ſpirit; becauſe he hath no better evidence, or ground for the teſtimony he gives, then the other mans owne word in commendation of his owne ſpirit; he neither ſeeth the ſpirit of the other, nor any ſigne where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it may be made credible; onely he may witneſſe that the man whoſe ſpirit it is, ſayeth, it is of God; but one mans word, in his owne caſe, is no ſufficient evidence for a lawfull teſtimony. Therefore there are no lawfull witneſſes for the private ſpirit, and conſequently, none can be obſtinate againſt us, becauſe none can be convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced that it is of God. Whence it followeth, that the ſpirit can be no ſufficient propoſall of Gods Word, or ſenſe; and therefore no inſpired Congregation of Proteſtants can be the Catholick Church.</p>

<pb n="49" facs="tcp:106315:32"/>Councells, of Florence, Lions, and the Lateran, they can not pretend to be the true Church, which never erred I do not ſpeake of that part of the Greeke Church which communicates with us Roman Catholicks, becauſe that is part of the Roman. But ſuppoſe the Roman Church were not the Catholick, I ſee not what advantage Proteſtants may have by pleading for the Grecians, ſeeing theſe agree not with them, but are altogether againſt the pretended Reformation, and condemne it as Hereſie, as appeares by the anſwer of the Patriarch of Conſtantinople to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants of Germany, mentioned by <hi>Bellarmine lib.</hi> 3. <hi>de Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>char. cap.</hi> 21. <hi>in fine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2 To prove therefore that the Roman Church is the true Catholick, it muſt be made appeare, that it propoſeth ſufficiently its Doctrine of Faith, as Divine Revelation, this ſufficient propoſall can not be done by cleare and evident reaſon, becauſe the myſteries of Chriſtian Religion are above humane capacity. Therefore it muſt be done (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to what hath beene ſaid in the 4. <hi>Chap.</hi>) by autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and the teſtimony of lawfull witneſſes. But lawfull witneſſes in matters of Faith, are onely they, whoſe teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony hath beene confirmed by miracles, as hath beene demonſtrated in the 2. <hi>Chap.</hi> Therefore we muſt prove alſo miracles, if we intend to prove that the Roman Church is the whole Catholick, and that it propoſeth ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently its Doctrine as Divine Revelation. Now to the proofe of the aſſertion.</p>
               <p n="3">3 That Doctrine is ſufficiently propoſed as Divine Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation, which is delivered to us as ſuch by the teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of lawfull witneſſes, confirmed by miracles. But the Doctrine of the Church of Rome is delivered to us as Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Revelation by the teſtimony of lawfull witneſſes, and their teſtimony is confirmed by miracles. Therefore its ſufficiently propoſed as Divine Revelation, and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence the Church of Rome is the true Catholick</p>
               <p n="4">4 If the Minor, or ſecond propoſition be proved, my intent is concluded. That the Roman Church hath law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full witneſſes of its Doctrine to be Divine Revelation, hath this difficulty: A lawfull witneſſe requires not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly knowledge of what he teſtifieth, but alſo honeſty; both qualities are neceſſary, an honeſt foole being as lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle to be credited as a knowing knave. But how can the
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:106315:33"/>Roman Church now extant in the 17. age of Chriſtianity, have lawfull witneſſes of the Doctrine, and ſenſe of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which <hi>Chriſt</hi> and the Apoſtles taught the world ſo long ſince? Though honeſty can not be denyed to many Roman Catholicks, yet the knowledge what the Apoſtles taught, which is required for a lawfull witneſſe of the true Church, can not be granted to any, ſeeing none is now living on earth, that converſed with the Apoſtles. This argument doth equally impugne all Churches, yet none can anſwer it but we Roman Catholicks.</p>
               <p n="5">5 It concernes all the world, even our very adverſaries, to grant, that the Roman Catholicks have lawfull wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes with ſufficient knowledge of what Religion, and ſenſe of Scripture was taught by the Apoſtles in the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Church, nay which is more, that no other Church pretending to Reformation, can have ſufficient know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge required for lawfull witneſſes of the true Religion, ſenſe of Scripture, and Doctrine of the primitive Church. If the Roman Church hath not ſufficient knowledge for lawfull witneſſes of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and the Apoſtles Doctrine, no hereditary King, or Prince, can have a title, or right to his crowne; becauſe the right deſcended to them by inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, doth depend upon a lawfull teſtimony averring, that they are the true heires of ſuch a man, who reigned perhaps three or four hundred yeares ago. <hi>Henry</hi> the IV. of France proved himſelfe by lawfull witneſſes to be the heire of Saint <hi>Lewis</hi> But who couldbe a lawfull witneſſe that <hi>Henry the Great</hi> deſcended of Saint <hi>Lewis?</hi> All France did give a lawfull teſtimony of it, becauſe it was a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant tradition in the whole Kingdome, deſcended from Saint <hi>Lewis</hi> his time to this preſent age. That is to ſay, in every Century, or age, there were honeſt men, and lawfull witneſſes who teſtified, that <hi>Henry</hi> the IV: Anceſtors deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended from Saint <hi>Lewis;</hi> though one onely age could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, or ſee Saint <hi>Lewis,</hi> yet the next enſuing did ſee the firſt, and heard their teſtimony; the third did ſee the ſecond <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In every age did live men whoſe teſtimony might be relyed upon. It muſt be granted therefore by all, that the knowledge which is grounded upon a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall, and never interrupted tradition, is ſufficient for law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full witneſſes.</p>
               <p n="6">6 That the Roman Catholick Church hath a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:106315:33"/>and never interrupted tradition of its Faith, and ſenſe of Scripture being taught by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and the Apoſtles, can not be denyed by our adverſaries, it being evident to the world, that they who contradicted any article of this Faith we now profeſſe, in former ages, were looked upon, and condemned as Hereticks; which is an infallible argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that we, in every age, received our Doctrine from the former not as the word of men, but as the Word of God, or as Divine Revelation: for, if it were not believed as Divine Revelation, why ſhould we condemne men as Hereticks, becauſe they denyed it? Neither do Proteſtants deny, that we believed our tradition, and the teſtimony of our Church, to be grounded upon Divine Revelation; they onely ſay we were miſtaken, and that both our tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and teſtimony of the Roman Church was fallible. But then we urge, that they acknowledge both were infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible in delivering to them the Scripture, and teſtifying that it was the Word of God: therefore in delivering, and teſtifying all the reſt, ſeeing the ſame teſtimony deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering many things together, muſt be of equall authority in all, and equally believed by them who accept of it as a lawfull proofe. All our pretended Reformers had no other ground in the yeare 1517. to believe Scripture as Divine Revelation, but the teſtimony of the Roman Church. Therefore they ought to believe all the reſt, or not to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve Scripture.</p>
               <p n="7">7 I ſaid, it concernes alſo our adverſaries to grant, that their reformed Churches have no lawfull witneſſes in matters of Faith; becauſe there can not be that ſufficient knowledge which is required in a lawfull witneſſe of Faith, without tradition, whereby it may appeare, that the Faith and ſenſe of Scripture of this age doth agree with that of the primitive Church. If once our adverſaries acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge lawfull witneſſes of things paſt long ſince, without a conſtant, and never interrupted tradition, every man whoſe ſpirit of ambition moves him, may pretend to be true heire of any hereditary crowne, or eſtate; and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out further proofe then his owne word, and ſpirit, or ſome obſcure text of Scripture, will exclude Kings and others, whoſe rights are grounded upon tradition. But if tradition be ſo neceſſary to preſerve, and make credible the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of men in matters of eſtates, and rights in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:106315:34"/>it can not be ſuperfluous to make credible the teſtimony of men concerning matters of Faith.</p>
               <p n="8">8 It remaines now we prove that the teſtimony of the Roman Catholick Church hath beene confirmed with ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaturall ſignes, or miracles. But ſeeing there are in the Roman Church lawfull witneſſes who prove, that the Faith which they now profeſſe, is the ſame with that of the primitive Church, miracles alſo are proved by the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me witneſſes, it being granted by Proteſtants themſelves, that miracles were wrought in the primitive Church to confirme the Faith, which <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and his Apoſtles taught. Yet in the Roman Catholick Church there are now law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full witneſſes, and have beene in every age ſince <hi>Christs</hi> preaching, that there have beene miracles done in confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the Roman Faith. This is evident to all who read the Eccleſiaſticall Hiſtories of preſent, and paſt times. Neither can our adverſaries deny, that we have lawfull witneſſes for miracles now wrought in our Church (even in confirmation of that Doctrine wherein we differ from them) and reported by ſo credible teſtimonies,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>See the</hi> 13. <hi>Chap.</hi>
                  </note> that it were imprudence in any perſon whoſoever to deny them, which is enough to propoſe ſufficiently our Doctrine as Divine Revelation.</p>
               <p>But Proteſtants do not believe our miracles, becauſe they imagine that they are againſt Scriptures, that is, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their owne interpretation of it, and that ſome mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles have beene falſe, and forged. We do not ſay that all things which the common people thinke to be mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, are really true miracles; but we affirme that true mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles there are in our Church, and very frequent, confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming that very Doctrine which Proteſtants reject: the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery or knavery of ſome particular wicked men in feig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning miracles, can not prejudice all, eſpecially ſuch as are ſeene, and experimented by perſons of knowne integrity, and learning, able to diſcerne betweene true and falſe mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles: otherwiſe it will follow, that all the new Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment muſt be called in queſtion, or denyed to be Gods Word, becauſe Saint <hi>Thomas</hi> his pretended Ghoſpell, or <hi>Nicodemus</hi> his writings are condemned as forged, or Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cryphall.</p>
               <p>That no reformed Church of Proteſtants can have law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full witneſſes to propoſe ſufficiently their Doctrine as Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:106315:34"/>Revelation, is evident; becauſe for the ſpace of 1500. yeares, they were without any viſible Church, or tradition; therefore their witneſſes alſo are inviſible, and by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence not lawfull, or credible. <hi>Fox</hi> and others made a certaine Catalogue of men who oppoſed the Doctrine of the Roman Church in former ages; but they were known Hereticks, and did neither agree amongſt themſelves, nor with Proteſtants, in their Tenets, or Religion, as hath beene demonſtrated by Father <hi>Perſons</hi> in his Examination of <hi>Fox</hi> his Kalendar, and by many others.</p>
               <p n="9">9 I conclude therefore, that ſeeing Proteſtants grant there is, and hath alwayes beene a Catholick Church upon earth, and that Church muſt have lawfull witneſſes teſtify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Doctrine to be Divine Revelation; it being evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that no Congregation of men can produce any ſuch lawfull witneſſes, but the Roman Catholicks (amongſt whom I include alſo them of the Greeke Church who a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree with us) its alſo evident, that there can be no Church Catholick but the Roman.</p>

               </head>
               <p n="1">1 THere are ſo many Bookes printed in defence of theſe Catholick Tenets, that I judge it ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous to treate of them <hi>ex profeſſo.</hi> I will onely anſwer ſome exceptions that Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants have made againſt them to my ſelfe, in diverſe occaſions. That the Roman Church doth propoſe theſe articles ſufficiently as Divine Revelation, is cleare; becauſe it propoſeth them by the ſame teſtimony, and confirmed by the ſames ſignes, whereby it propoſeth Scripture to be Gods Word: this laſt propoſall Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants themſelves grant to be ſo ſufficient, that no man
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:106315:35"/>may in prudence deny it. Therefore the ſame muſt be ſaid of all the reſt, and in particular of <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> and <hi>worſhip of Images.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2 But let us heare the exceptions of Proteſtants againſt each of theſe myſteries. Againſt <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> they object the evidence of our ſenſes; it never being read in Scripture (ſay they) that God by a miracle deceived mens ſenſes, or made appeare to them one thing for another. <hi>Moyſes</hi> and <hi>Aarons</hi> rod in Egypt, was really converted into a ſerpent, and ſeemed ſo alſo to the ſenſes of the ſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors. The Magicians rods ſeemed to be ſerpents to the ſenſes, but really were not. From hence they conclude, that by falſe miracles, and illuſions the ſenſes may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, but never by true ſupernaturall ſignes, or mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles. Againſt <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> they object alſo novelty of the word, and of the thing defined, which was in the Councell of <hi>Lateran</hi> firſt, and after in the Councell of <hi>Trent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3 As for <hi>worſhip of Images</hi> they looke upon it as ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, or at leaſt as a thing inclining the common people to it, and therefore both dangerous, and unlawfull. Some object alſo novelty againſt it, the firſt time (ſay they) <hi>wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of Images</hi> was heard of, being ſome 800. yeares ago, in the ſecond Councell of <hi>Nice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4 Now to their firſt exception, and the evidence of their ſenſes againſt <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> I anſwer, that the ſenſes are not deceived, becauſe (according to common Philoſophie) their proper object (which are the accidents) do remaine. But ſeeing divers both Catholicks, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants do deny that there be any accidents ſeparable from their proper ſubſtance, my ſecond anſwer is, That there are two ſorts of miracles. Some miracles are wrought, not to be ſeene, but to be believed; becauſe they are not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly miracles, but alſo myſteries of Chriſtian Faith. The In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation, or Union of God and man in one perſon is one of the greateſt miracles, yet it was not done to be ſeene, or manifeſted to our ſenſes in this life, but (being concealed from them) to be believed. The miracle of <hi>Tranſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation</hi> is called by <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelfe <hi>Myſterium Fidei,</hi> a myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of Faith; it was not done to be perceived by our ſenſes, but to be believed by our underſtanding.</p>
               <p n="5">5 Other miracles there are which have been wrought
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:106315:35"/>by God, to the end they may move us to believe, not themſelves, (for they are ſeene, and manifeſt) but ſome other revealed truth; theſe miracles are patent to our ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, becauſe they give us ſufficient evidence, that the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries of Faith may prudently be credited as Divine Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation. Such was <hi>Moyſes</hi> his miracles in Egypt; the rod was not turned into a ſerpent, that <hi>Pharao,</hi> and the Egyptians ſhould believe what they did ſee with their eyes, but that they ſhould believe ſomewhat elſe, to wit, that <hi>Moyſes</hi> was ſent by God.</p>
               <p n="6">6 Suppoſing this difference betweene miracles, there can be no difficulty in anſwering the objection made by Proteſtants againſt <hi>Tranſubstantiation.</hi> Miracles which are not wrought principally to the end that they may be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved by Faith, but rather to the end they may be evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently ſeene, and by their meanes other myſteries belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, can not deceive the ſenſes; becauſe then they would be of no uſe, Gods providence, and end in working them, would be fruſtrated. Miracles which are together myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of Faith, and are done that they may be believed, and not ſeene, muſt not appeare evidently to our ſenſes, but rather be concealed from them; otherwiſe we ſhould have evidence, and beliefe of one thing in the ſame time. The myſtery of <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> is a miracle not to be evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently ſeene, but to be believed. Therefore its no mervaile that it be not patent to our ſenſes: when <hi>Chriſt</hi> turned water into wine, he did it in ſuch a manner, that the ſenſe perceived it to be wine, becauſe from that evident and ſenſible miracle, they might inferre, and believe, that he was the true <hi>Meſſias.</hi> But when he changed bread, and wine into his owne Body, and Bloud, there was no appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of change, it ſeemed to remaine ſtill bread, becauſe the inſenſible change of one ſubſtance to another, was a myſtery to be credited, and not to be ſeene. The <hi>Manna</hi> (which was a figure of the Bleſſed Sacrament of the Altar) did ſavour to the Jewes whatſoever they fancied, though it remained the ſame ſubſtance it was before: I ſee there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no reaſon why we Chriſtians ſhould give more cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit to our palat, then the Jewes, who had as much rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to doubt of the <hi>Manna,</hi> as we of the Sacrament; nay we have leſſe, becauſe <hi>Chriſts</hi> words are ſo abſolutely, and cleare, <hi>This is my Body:</hi> if it be his Body, it is not bread;
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:106315:36"/>being impoſſible that <hi>Chriſts</hi> Body ſhould be bread.</p>
               <p n="7">7 Seeing God will not have the myſtery of <hi>Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation</hi> be evident to our ſenſes, its not to be thought either ſuperfluous or incredible, that the ſpecies, or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of bread and wine, worke the ſame effects, which their ſubſtance would have done, if it were preſent: for, God is as coherent in ſupernaturall things, as in naturall; its neceſſary therefore for the concealment of this myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and for the merit of Chriſtian Faith, that no want of the ſubſtance of bread, and wine, may be perceived in the Sacrament by any curious experience of men, who would eate, and drinke onely conſcerated ſpecies. The not mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſting this great myſtery to our ſenſes, requireth, that the ſame effects be worked by the ſpecies, as by bread, and wine.</p>
               <p n="8">8 Some Proteſtants thinke it a contradiction that one body be preſent in many places together. But all Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks hold that <hi>Chriſts</hi> Body, and Bloud, have a ſpirituall preſence in the Sacrament, which once granted, there can be no difficulty in believing that our Saviours Body, and Bloud, may be in many places at the ſame time; becauſe its granted to all things which have a ſpirituall preſence.</p>
               <p n="9">9 If any inquires, how can a body have a ſpirituall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence? I anſwer him with demanding, how can a ſpirit have a corporall preſence? How can an Angel have the appearance, and preſence of a young man? whereof there are many examples in Scriptures Whence it followeth, that our ſenſes may be deceived, or (to ſpeake more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly) may give occaſion to the underſtanding to be decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, not onely in the myſtery of <hi>Tranſubstantiation,</hi> but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo in others, expreſſed in Scripture; which is contrary to what our adverſaries object. Angells ſeemed to the eyes of <hi>Abraham, Ioſue, Tobias,</hi> and others to be young men, and yet they were not men, but ſpirits.</p>
               <p n="10">10 As for their ſaying that <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> is a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velty brought into the Church by the Councell of <hi>Lateran an.</hi> 1215. its a miſtake; becauſe the very condemning of of <hi>Berengarius</hi> as an Heretick, for impugning this myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, doth demonſtrate it was no novelty; but believed as an atticle of Faith, not onely before the Councell of <hi>Late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran,</hi> but ſince the Apoſtles. For otherwiſe, how were it poſſible that the Patriarchs of Hieruſalem, and Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:106315:36"/>70. Metropolitanes, 400. Biſhops, and 800. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventuall Priors, who were preſent at that Councell, ſhould all agree to declare <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> to have beene revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by God to the primitive Church, and yet the ſame to be at the ſame time invented, when the Councell defined it? The Church doth not make new articles of Faith when it defines any controverted Doctrine, it onely declares, that ſuch Doctrine was delivered to the primitive Church, though perhaps it was not propoſed generally to all Churches, and Catholicks; it groundeth the definition up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Scripture, or Tradition. The ſame which Proteſtants object againſt the word <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> did the Arrians againſt <hi>Conſubſtantiality</hi> in the Councell of <hi>Nice,</hi> ſaying it was a novelty, and not in Scripture.</p>
               <p n="11">11 The lawfulneſſe of worſhipping <hi>Images</hi> is ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly propoſed as Divine Revelation by the ſecond Councell of <hi>Nice</hi> in theſe words: <hi>VVe do unanimouſly profeſſe to ſtick to Eccleſiaſticall traditions which are in force eather by cuſtome, or writing; whereof one is the making of Images, Which is agreable to the Ghospell, and profitably invented for the beliefe of Gods true Incarnation.

Fifthly, no Church hath continuall tradition, and ſucceſſion of Doctrine, but we Roman Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks.</p>
               <p n="8">8 All theſe ſigns are marks of the true Catholick Church, and are ſo obvious to our ſenſes, that idiots may take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of them; if they will but inquire, and ſpend as much time in that, as in reading the Hiſtory of their owne Countrey, or of informing themſelves of their Anceſtors. This is the true reaſon why no Proteſtants can pretend ignorance of the true Church, nor rely upon the word of their Miniſters. If they inquire not, they will be damned for being ignorant. If after due inquiry made, they beco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me not Roman Catholicks, they will be damned for He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie, not onely for denying the truth of our Doctrine, and Faith, but alſo the ſufficiency of its propoſal He is a rebell who denyeth, that the accuſtomed exterior ſignes of the Princes commiſſion, and authority, which are ſeene in his Officers, is not a ſufficient propoſall of his will and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, to have the ſaid Officers obeyed as his Judges, or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties &amp;c. I ſee no reaſon why the ſame ought not to be grated (with proportion) in our caſe; unleſſe Proteſtants thinke that Princes ought to be more reſpected in their Miniſters, then God in his Church; or that there is greater evidence required to believe that God doth ſpeake by his Church, then to believe that Princes do ſpeake by their ſubordinate Miniſters. Truly though this greater evidence were required, Proteſtants can have no excuſe, becauſe the ſignes of the Roman Church are greater evidence, that it alone is the true one, by which God declares, and ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his minde, then the ſignes of any Magiſtrate in a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, or Kingdome, are of the true regall autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the ſaid Magiſtrate, by which Kings, and Princes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare their minde to the Subjects.

               <head>CHAP. XIII. <hi>VVhether any Proteſtants may be ſaved?</hi>
               </head>
               <p n="1">1 THough Proteſtancy be Hereſie, all Proteſtants are not Hereticks; there is a difference (ſaith Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi>) betweene Hereticks, and them who believe Hereticks. The greateſt wits may be miſinformed, if they rely upon other mens informations.</p>
               <p n="2">2 To the queſtion propoſed I anſwer, that ſuch Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants as never had any occaſion to doubt, whether their owne Religion be the true one, may be ſaved, if they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver committed a mortall ſinne; becauſe they are baptiſed, and dye in the grace of God, which they received in the Baptiſme. Now whether there be any Proteſtants who never committed a mortall ſinne, the Lord knowes; this I am ſure of, that there are very few in any part of the world, who have not great reaſon, and many occaſions to doubt of their owne Religion. Becauſe amongſt them, or neare unto the places where they live, there are Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks; who (as Chriſtians and true Friends) advertiſe them of the falſhood, and novelty of their Sect. And though the Proteſtant Miniſters aſſure them, that they are in a ſafe way of ſalvation; when others as honeſt, and learned as the Miniſters tell them the contrary, they are bound, under paine of damnation, at leaſt to examine the truth, and grounds of both Religions, according their capacity, and poſſibility; which if they do ſincerely, that is, ſetting aſide all regard of honour, intereſt, conveniency, and all other temporall affections, which obſtruct the underſtanding, God in his providence will give them knowledge of the truth, and reſolution to embrace it.</p>
               <p n="3">3 But in caſe Proteſtants contemne the charitable war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings given them by Catholicks, of the Schiſme, and He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie wherein they are involved, and neglect Gods inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of examining the truth; there is no queſtion to be made that if they dye in that condition, they are damned; becauſe though they were brought up Proteſtants, they had reaſon to doubt of their Religion, ſeeing as honeſt, and
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:106315:41"/>learned men as thoſe that gave them their education, and inſtruction, advertiſed them ſeriouſly of their danger. And not to examine whether the danger be reall, or not, in a matter of ſo high concernment, is not excuſable; no igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance can be pretended, after they are admoniſhed by ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and honeſt men.</p>
               <p>I conclude therefore, that onely ſuch ſilly ſoules as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Pope hath hornes, and the Jeſuits cloven feete, can be excuſed by ignorance from damnation, for not believing as Catholicks doe; becauſe if any ſuch be, they are ſo ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that they believe all which the Miniſter ſayes, as Gods Word, and that nothing ought to be called in queſtion. How many Miniſters there be, who deſerve this credit, and eſteeme of infallibility, even amongſt the leaſt prying, and ſimple people, let their owne Pariſhes, and the world defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne. This I dare ſay, that there are few Proteſtants who commit not at leaſt one mortall ſinne; and that is enough to damne them, though their invincible ignorance (as ſchoole men ſpeake) may excuſe their want of true Faith. But the want of Charity is as damnable as the want of Faith; and we have no reaſon to judge that God will do ſo extraordinary a favour to Proteſtants, who are out of the Church, and have not the helpe of the true Sacraments, as to give them an act of contrition in the laſt houre.</p>
               <p n="4">4 I have often ſaid, that I can not but admire to ſee any perſon of ſolid judgement, and good underſtanding, a Proteſtant. The more I conſider the grounds, beginning, and progreſſe of theſe new Religions, the more I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed in my admiration What matter can then be of greater wonder, then to ſee wiſe men preferre the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of ſome few wanton, and diſſolute Prieſts, and Friars, to the teſtimony of the grave, and ancient Fathers of the Catholick Roman Church? Let the Councell of <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teran</hi> be confronted with <hi>Cranmer,</hi> and the ſix or ſeven Miniſters, who invented the Engliſh Church, and with the Parliament that confirmed it. Let both the Councells of <hi>Lateran,</hi> and that of <hi>Trent,</hi> be compared with the petty Aſſemblies of Miniſters in the Engliſh Proteſtant Church, or in the Kirke of Scotland, <hi>Dort,</hi> or any other, pretending Reformation. Shall a few Miniſters know better the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick tradition, the ſenſe of Scripture, and Fathers, then the Councell of <hi>Lateran,</hi> wherein ſate two Patriarchs, and
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:106315:41"/>the Pope, 70. Metropolitans, 400. Biſhops, 800 Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall Priors, all learned men, out of the moſt parts of Chriſtendome? Shall one Apoſtate <hi>Paulo Dolce</hi> his word be taken concerning the Councell of <hi>Trent,</hi> and preferred to the teſtimony of all the Catholick Churches, which hath accepted all its Decrees in matters of Faith? I ſpeake not of other Councells, nor of the cleare teſtimonies of Fathers, which are obvious to all perſons who underſtand Latin, in <hi>Bellarmine, Coccius,</hi> and other Authors.</p>
               <p n="5">5 Moſt of all I admire to ſee any perſon ſtick to the Common prayer Booke, or to that Church, as if it were the true Catholick. How is it poſſible, that God ſhould permit the publick exerciſe of Catholick Religion, and Church, to be brought ſo low, and to ſo narrow a compaſſe, as we ſee the Common prayer? If Antichriſt reigne were come, or the Turke had poſſeſſed the whole world, then it might be thought, that the Church fled to the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and became almoſt inviſible; but when (through the mercy of God) we ſee Chriſtianity flouriſh, not onely in Europe, but in all other parts of the world, how is it cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible, that God ſhould permit the true, and pure exerciſe of Catholick Religion to be inviſible?</p>
               <p n="6">6 Therefore I judge it a duty of conſcience, and chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to warne all Proteſtants, that they may be pleaſed to reflect upon the Authors, and firſt Apoſtles of their Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation Is it credible that God would make choice of ſuch wicked perſons as they were knowne to be, to reform his Church? Suppoſe there were ſome abuſes in the Court of Rome; muſt therefore the Popes authority be tread un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der foot? Muſt Kings looſe their Crownes, becauſe ſome Courtiours are lewd? If <hi>Luther</hi> had beene appointed to preach for Indulgences, he had never writ againſt them, the Pope, or the Church of Rome. If <hi>Henry</hi> the VIII. had prevailed with the Pope to declare null his mariage with Queene <hi>Catharine</hi> of Spaine, he had never made himſelfe ſpirituall Head of the Church of England. If <hi>Calvin</hi> had obtained the Biſhoprick of <hi>Geneva,</hi> Puritans had never beene ſo fierce againſt Epiſcopacy. If Queene <hi>Elizabeth</hi> had not beene declared illegitimate by the Doctrine, and Church of Rome, the Common prayer, and Reformation had ended with <hi>Edward</hi> the VI. who begunne it. Doth not the world ſee, that theſe pretended Reformations of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:106315:42"/>were onely pretexts for Princes to obtaine their po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litick ends; and for diſſolute, and incontinent Clergy, to gaine authority, whereby their liberty, and vices might not onely be excuſed, but applauded by the ignorant, and common people. Let Proteſtants therefore examine how things paſt, becauſe ignorance in ſo important a matter can not be warranted by relying upon other mens judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, ſeeing they may ſo eaſily informe their owne.</p>
               <p n="7">7 Neither ought they to ſooth themſelves with that no leſſe uſuall, then groundleſſe excuſe. Agree you Clergy men amongſt your ſelves, and we will agree, &amp; ſubmit our judgements &amp;c. But untill then, we are not obliged, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our Miniſters are learned, and honeſt men. We Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks declare to all the world, and the ſame muſt Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant do, that the Church out of which there is no ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, may be ſo eaſily diſcerned from all falſe Sects, by ſignes ſo viſible and obvious to all perſons though illite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, that to truſt to Miniſters teſtimony in ſo important a matter, is damnable negligence; eſpecially ſeeing we charge them of not believing Clergy men, nor ordained. As for the Proteſtant Miniſters being learned, and honeſt men, its certaine that either we, or they want learning, or honeſty, and that either they, or we impoſe upon the people manifeſt falſhoods; which may eaſily be diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by any perſon, that deſires to be ſaved. Let our Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, and Tenets be examined, and it will clearly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, that the Proteſtant Faith doth tend to liberty of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving, and doing what every man thinkes convenient; which is an infallible marke of Hereſie, and damnation.</p>

                  <p n="1">1 THe true Chriſtian and Catholick Religion is ſo evidently credible, that all others muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily be evidently incredible. It is not in Religion, as in caſes of morall Divinity. Two contrary opinions in morall matters may be prudently followed; each of them as probable; becauſe there are learned men that patronize both. If there were two, or more Gods, and they could differ in opinion, or judgement, men might accommodate themſelves to which they pleaſed But ſeeing there is but one God, there muſt be but one Faith, and one Religion. This one Faith is more then any probable opinion, it is an undoubted and prudent aſſent of the underſtanding, to whatſoever is ſufficiently propoſed as Divine Revelation. An undoubted and prudent aſſent doth ſuppoſe there can be no prudent probability in any other contrary Faith, or Church: for, if once we grant, that two Religions are probable, or pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently credible, we have none at all; becauſe we reſerve a doubt of both, and are indifferent for any. True Faith ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits no doubts, or indifferencies. Suppoſing this, no prudent Proteſtant can take ill that, which I intend to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve in this <hi>Chap.</hi> unleſſe he will have Catholicks acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that they have one true Faith, or Chriſtian Religion.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 If it be proved that Proteſtancy is contrary to reaſon, its evidently demonſtrated to be a falſe Religion, becauſe whatſoever is againſt reaſon can not be true. The true Chriſtian Faith doth perfect the underſtanding, and not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that faculty of man, whereby he is diſtinguiſhed from brute beaſts. God is the Author both of Reaſon, and
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:106315:43"/>Religion, one muſt be ſubordinate to the other; its true, Faith is above Reaſon, but never ſtands in oppoſition with it, there muſt be good correſpondence betweene both. Rationall creatures are ſaved by a rationall way There is a generation of men that thinke, none can enter into the true Church by Faith, if he leaves not his wits behind him at the doore; ſo great an <hi>antipathy</hi> they conceive is betweene Faith, and Reaſon, that to embrace the one, is to renounce holy, and exclude t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e other. This errour proceeds from confounding the myſtery believed with the beliefe. Its very certaine that the truth of Divine my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries ought not to be cenſured by human underſtanding, becauſe they are above its reach; that which ſeemeth to man very improbable, may be an infallible verity. But that we fall not into extreames, on the other ſide, its fit we know, that no perſon is bound to believe any myſtery he underſtands not, before he ſeeth reaſon to believe it: though that reaſon cleares not the myſtery, yet it makes manifeſt our obligation to believe it. None is bound to part with his ov<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ne Religion, or opinion, before he know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth upon what ſcore. There is nothing ſo much, and ſo properly our owne, as our thoughts; our lands, and all other properties may be forced from us, our thoughts can not, they remaine free, though our ſelves ſhould be ſlaves. Seeing therefore its a right of nature, not to part with our owne goods, being in poſſeſſion, unleſſe better evidence be produced by others, then we can ſhew for them; the ſame right muſt be extended to our thoughts, even in matters of Faith; becauſe the Law of grace doth rather perfect, then deſtroy the Law of nature, and equity.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 To prove that Proteſtancy is manifeſtly againſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, its enough to prove, that it is manifeſtly againſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to believe as Proteſtants do. There is not one article of any Proteſtant Church, oppoſite to the Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Faith, that is, not manifeſtly againſt reaſon in this ſenſe. This aſſertion may be proved firſt, becauſe Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy is Hereſie, as hath beene proved in the 12. <hi>Chap.</hi> and Hereſie is manifeſtly againſt reaſon; for Hereſie invol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves obſtinacy, and an obſtinate man is manifeſtly unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable; becauſe he is guided by his will, not by his under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding. None can properly be obſtinate, if not convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced; convinced none can be but by cleare reaſon, or by
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:106315:43"/>lawfull witneſſes, to whoſe teſtimony evident reaſon commands all men give credit, and ſubmit their judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, if there be not cleare evidence againſt it. All Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealths do acquieſce in, and take the word of honeſt men, in both publick, and private affaires; as in puniſhing Malefactors, diſpoſing of inheritances &amp;c. That the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholich Church hath a great multitude of lawfull witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and teſtimonies againſt Proteſtancy hath beene de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated. Therefore Proceſtancy is manifeſtly againſt naturall reaſon, which dictates to all rationall creatures to conform themſelves to the teſtimony of lawfull wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, when they have no evidence againſt the ſaid teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony. Proteſtants can not pretend evidence of reaſon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Catholick Tenets, becauſe they are above reaſon. Evidence of the private ſpirit is ridiculous, and incredible to others, therefore unfit for the true Catholick Church, as hath beene proved in the 9. <hi>Chap.</hi> There remaines one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly their pretended evidence, or clearneſſe of Scripture, which hath beene alſoo confuted in the 8. <hi>Chap.</hi> Other lawfull witneſſes againſt ours, they have none, unleſſe we grant that an inviſible Church never heard of before <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> hath lawfull teſtimonies. And as for the ſentences of ſome Fathers which they wreſt in their owne behalfe, we produce others againſt them of the ſame Fathers, in which they explaine themſelves. Therefore its manifeſtly againſt reaſon to believe as Proteſtants do, becauſe they have no prudent ground for Proteſtancy; their Faith is not above reaſon, but below it; that is, unfit to be embraced by any rationall creature.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 Another manner of proving Proteſtancy to be mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly againſt reaſon, is, by this cleare principle. When witneſſes, and teſtimonies are contrary, they onely are to be believed, who confirme what they ſay, with viſible, and evident ſignes.

Though the other was confident enough in teſtify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the child was her owne, yet becauſe her teſtimony was not confirmed by any exteriour, and viſible ſigne, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary teſtimony was preferred, and believed by <hi>Salomon.</hi> If we will judge of Religions, as wiſe, and rationall men, we
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:106315:44"/>muſt examine, which of all Chriſtian Churches teſtimony is confirmed with evident, and viſible ſignes. No Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Church (all of them being inviſible for ſo many ages) can pretend ſo evident, and viſible ſigne. The Roman Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church doth not onely pretend to viſible ſignes, but they are ſo evidently appearing in the ſaid Church, that no Proteſtant can deny them without forfeiting his judgement, or his ingenuity. The viſible ſignes of the true Church, muſt have ſo evident a relation to God the Author of both Church, and Faith, that whoſoever will reflect upon the ſaid ſignes, can not prudently deny that they are a ſufficient proofe of God being the Author of the Doctrine, or Faith confirmed by them. There can not be a more rationall and ſufficient proofe of any Doctrine being taught by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and his Apoſtles, then a continuall ſucceſſion from them to us, both of Paſtors, and Doctrine, delivered from age to age by the Doctors of the Church. See this in <hi>Eſay</hi> 59.21. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45.16. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.11.12.</p>
                  <p n="5">5 As for our ſucceſſion of Paſtors, it is confeſſed by Proteſtant. Our ſucceſſion of Doctrine from the Apoſtles to this preſent, muſt alſo be granted; becauſe they could never tell us (though continually preſſed in that particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar point) when did the Roman Church fall from the true, and ſincere Faith, which confeſſedly it once profeſſed And And truly before Proteſtants prove that the Roman Faith was changed in any age, they muſt firſt prove, that all the Paſtors, and Doctors of that age did conſpire together to damne both themſelves, and poſterity, or, if they did not conſpire to ſo incredible a thing, it muſt be neceſſarily ſaid, that in that age wherein the firſt change of any arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of Faith happened, all the Catholicks of the world we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remad, or ſlept for the ſpace of a hundred yeares; becau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe if they were awake, and ſober, its impoſſible, but in ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me parts of the world (nay in every part, and Countrey) ſome learned, and honeſt men would contradict ſo dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, and abominable practiſes, and advertiſe future ages of the innovation of Chriſtian Religion, contrary to cleare Scripture, and the knowne beliefe of all Catholicks in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ages. Its as evident therefore that we Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks have not changed that Faith, which we received from the Apoſtles, as it is evident, that there was not any age wherein all the world conſpired to damne themſelves, and
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:106315:44"/>their poſterity; or, as it is evident, that there was not any age wherein all the world was ſo benummed, ſtupified, or inchanted, that no Writer had the uſe of his fingers to ſet downe in writing a matter of ſo great conſequence; ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving notwithſtanding the free uſe of their penne in rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a thouſand other changes of leſſe importance. We have no reaſon to judge that former ages were leſſe vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant, and carefull in preſerving the purity of Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and the true ſenſe of Scripture, then the preſent is, becauſe their vigilancy appeareth by their ſuppreſſing of Hereſies in every age: which ſuppreſſion, and proteſtation againſt the ſaid Hereſies of every reſpective age, was never judged, or condemned, for an innovation againſt the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine received from former times; but rather is a confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of it; ſo that the exceptions made by <hi>Berengarius, VValdo,</hi> and other ſuch perſons againſt Roman Catholicks, doth rather ſtrengthen, then weaken the Doctrine of the Roman Church, ſeeing their exception was ſo ſtrongly, and conſtantly cryed downe by all the world for innovation.</p>
                  <p n="6">6 Some have ſaid, that as gray heares grow in a mans head, and the corruption of a language growes on by lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, and little, without particular notice taken of the preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe time; ſo the change, and corruption of Religion hath crept in inſenſibly in the Roman Catholick Church. But this is a moſt ſilly ſimilitude; as if men were as much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned to watch the new growth of every gray heare, or the miſpronunciation of every word, as the Paſtors, and Doctors of the Church, and all Chriſtians, are concerned to obſerve the beginning of a new article of Faith; or as if this were no more obſervable, or making no more impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion upon mens mindes, or no more change in the practiſe of the Church, then a gray haire in a mans head, or an odde word in common ſpeach. Put the caſe, that in this age, to fertile of ſopperies, ſome great, and conſiderable part of Chriſtianity ſhould ſet up a calfe to be adored for the God of the Chriſtians, would this be no more remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable then a gray haire in a mans head? No leſſe remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable is it to hold up a wafer cake for the like adoration; and over and above to oblige people to ſweare, that it is no bread. Is it credible, or poſſible, that if in <hi>Berengarius</hi> his time, this had beene begunne, that the whole world would not have cryed out againſt it, and not onely the
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:106315:45"/>Doctors out of Scriptue, but the very children out of their Cathechiſmes had cryed it downe; or that ſo many Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, and learned men aſſembled in ſo many Councells, namely in that moſt univerfall compleate Councell of <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teran,</hi> ſhould have declared ſo hard a matter to be a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies of Chriſtian Religion are not to be decided by examin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the truth of the myſteries we believe; that is to be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, and not diſputed. To be a good Controvertiſt, is not to give reaſon of what you believe; but to give reaſon why you believe what you underſtand not; this laſt requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res no Greek, or Hebrew, nor Schoole learning, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore may be as well performed by a Catholick Clowne, is by a Bachelour of <hi>Oxford,</hi> or <hi>Cambridge.</hi>

                  <p n="10">10 Now to deſcend to particular methods, hereby the learned Proteſtants may be convinced by illiterate Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks, I will onely mention two, both of them very ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and uſuall, amongſt the moſt vulgar ſort of people.
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:106315:46"/>The firſt is by asking of Proteſtants, What newes of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion? The ſecond by inquiring of them, by what right, or warrant, do they condemne any article of the Roman Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Faith? I do ſeriouſly averre, that every Countrey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, who hath wit, and judgement enough to except, at the Aſſiſes, againſt an illegall, and falſe witneſſe, hath leam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing enough to convince in controverſies of Religion, the moſt learned Proteſtant Miniſter. And every carrier, or husbandman, who hath ſo much wit, and judgement, as not to believe an extravagant, and incredible hiſtory, or ballads, of ſome ſtrange feigned Monſter, hath wit, and judgement enough to convince any Proteſtant whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. The reaſon of this Aſſertion is very cleare; becauſe there was never ſo incredible a Monſter, or <hi>Chymera,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of ſo many contradictions, and impoſſibilities, as this new fangled Religion, framed by the fancies of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of diſſolute Prieſts, and Friars, pretending to have beene enlightened by the Spirit of God, and ſent by an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary calling (without miracles) to reforme not onely the manners, but alſo the Doctrine of the Catholick Church. What Countrey Clowne amongſt Catholicks can be perſuaded to believe, that all this which the firſt Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants pretend, is true? Is it not obvious to every rationall creature, that God never made uſe of ſo wicked inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to reforme the world, and plant the true Religion. What evidence do Reformers produce againſt the Doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne of the Roman Church? what witneſſes? what ſignes to confirme their teſtimonies? Do Proteſtants agree amongſt themſelves? All this will be more clearly underſtood by the enſuing Conference betweene a Catholick Clowne, and a learned Proteſtant Miniſter.</p>

But its incredible newes to me that, which you tell me, of any abuſes we ſhould have in our Church, contrary to the expreſſe Word of God. <hi>Miniſt.</hi> Didſt thou ever read the Scripture? <hi>Cath.</hi> No truly. <hi>Minist.</hi> I knew ſo much: the reaſon why ye are not permitted to read the Bible, is, that ye may not diſcover the errours which Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits, and other Maſſe Prieſts teach ye; as the reſpect to Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and Statues, praying to Saints, Purgatory &amp;c. Theſe, and many more are clearly contradicted by Scripture. <hi>Cath.</hi> Though I were permitted to read Scripture, I can not; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I never learned to read. Yet I have ſpoken with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny learned men who read Scripture, and they all unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly aſſure me, that there is not one word in all Scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, contradicting <hi>worſhip of Images, praying to Saints,</hi> or <hi>Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory.</hi> Now, I ſee no reaſon why I ſhould reject their te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony, and take yours.</p>

<pb n="78" facs="tcp:106315:47"/>yeares paſt, all Roman Catholicks did hold damnable Doctrine, manifeſtly contrary to Scripture, yet I believe their ignorance did excuſe them from damnation.</p>
                  <p n="13">13 <hi>Caeh.</hi> How is it poſſible that there ſhould be ſo much ignorance in all the world for the ſpace of a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand yeares that none could ſee thoſe cleare texts of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture which you, and other Proteſtants pretend to ſee? <hi>Min.</hi> Miſtake me not Countreyman, the texts of Scripture which we produce againſt your errours, and ſuperfluities, are not ſo very cleare, but that they may be miſunderſtood, if God doth not enlighten the underſtanding, as he hath done to us Proteſtants. <hi>Cath.</hi> I thought you pretended no ſuch Spirit, or private inſpiration. I heare reported by cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible Authors, that the firſt Proteſtants, or Reformers in every Countrey, were diſſolute Pieſts, or Friars, who mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, and lived not ſo exemplarly as the Catholick Clergy doth. Therefore I can not perſuade my ſelfe, that God would enlighten them more then us; at leaſt I am not bound to believe it, unleſſe I ſee miracles, or ſome other markes of ſanctity, which is more then ever I perceived as yet in any of your Religion. I hope you will pardon my freedome. <hi>Min.</hi> I warrant thou doſt believe all the mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles that are reported to have beene done at <hi>Loreto, Sichem,</hi> and other Chappells Didſt thou ever ſee any miracle thy ſelfe? <hi>Cath.</hi> No indeed, but I have ſeene others who were preſent at the working of ſtrange miracles, as that of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,</hi> when the Jefuit <hi>Maſtrilli</hi> was cured on a ſudden by Saint <hi>Francis Xaverius,</hi> and ſent by him to <hi>lapon,</hi> where he dyed a Martyr. Many others I have heard teſtified by cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible Authors, that I have as much reaſon to believe, as any who ſhould endeavour to perſuade me the contrary; therefore trouble not your ſelfe in this matter, unleſſe you will have me doubt of all things I heare, becauſe I have been deceived in ſomething <hi>Min.</hi> Why believe not ye our miracles, as ye would have us believe yours? <hi>Cath.</hi> Becau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe we never heare of any cleare, and undeniable miracles; I am ſure ye have none to confirme the articles wherein ye Proteſtants differ from us, no nor any that lookes like miracles when they are compared with ours.</p>

<pb n="79" facs="tcp:106315:47"/>cleare; muſt they not therefore be believed, becauſe (for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth) they are obſcure. Chriſtian Faith muſt be obſcure, honeſt fellow. Doth not thy Pariſh Prieſt inſtruct thee thus? <hi>Cath.</hi> My Paſtor, and Confeſſor both tell me, that the myſteries of Chriſtian Faith are obſcure, but never in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible. <hi>Min.</hi> Now friend I have caught thee. Is it not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible that there is no bread in the Sacrament of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar? Why therefore doſt thou believe <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> as a myſtery of Faith? <hi>Cath.</hi> It is rather incredible there ſhould be any bread in the bleſſed Sacrament; for if there were, why ſhould all Catholicks deny a thing that hath ſo great appearance? Whether bread be there, or no, Prieſts have the ſame almes for ſaying Maſſe: no gaine acrues to them by <hi>Tranſubstantiation.</hi> On the other ſide, its impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that all Catholicks ſhould be ſo mad, as to contradict their own ſenſes, if God had not commanded them not to credit their eyes and taſt in this Divine myſtery; but rather to rely upon his words, and believe, that the bleſſed Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is his Body: if it be <hi>Christs</hi> Body, it can not be bread, becauſe our bodies are no bread, and <hi>Chriſts</hi> Body is of the ſame nature with ours.</p>

                        <hi>Iohn</hi> 6.</note> I heard our Paſtor the laſt Sonday explaine that ſame text to confirme <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation.</hi> For, he ſaid, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> is in the Sacrament truly, and really, but with a ſpirituall preſence, and that we receive his very Body, and Bloud, though not in a corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall manner: there is ſome difference (quoth he) betweene eating of <hi>Chriſts</hi> Fleſh, and eating a piece of beefe.

Whether bread be there, or no, <hi>Chriſts</hi> true Body, and Bloud, is received in the Communion, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording Proteſtants; ſo that it concerns them, as much as Catholicks, to interpret theſe words of <hi>Chriſts,</hi> as we do: unleſſe ye will become Calviniſts, by ſaying, that ye eate <hi>Chriſts</hi> Body by Faith; that is, ye believe to receive him, when ye do not; which is a lying, and falſe Faith; or that ye receive his grace, but not himſelf; and that is to deny in plain termes, the reall preſence. All this did our Paſtor teach in the Cathechiſme.</p>
                  <pb n="80" facs="tcp:106315:48"/>
                  <p n="16">16 <hi>Min.</hi> Well, in this matter none is bound to believe your Paſtor, or his Cathechiſme: we believe that <hi>Chriſt</hi> is really preſent in the Sacrament; but how he is there, we do not examine; neither ought the Roman Church, or the Councell of <hi>Lateran</hi> impoſe <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> upon us, as a thing neceſſary to be believed. <hi>Cath.</hi> I have heard talke much of that Councell of <hi>Lateran,</hi> they ſay there were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent thereat the <hi>Pope,</hi> and two Pattiarchs of the Eaſt, 70. Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolitans, 400. Biſhops, and 800 other learned men, out of all parts of the world If <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> was not a neceſſary article of Faith, they did very ill to declare it one, and condemne as Hereticks all ſuch as denyed it. Yet me thinks, the teſtimony of ſo many learned men is of greater weight (I pray Sir, pardon me if I offend you, I do not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend it) then the teſtimony of any reformed Church to the contrary. I never heard of ſuch a Councell in any Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Church. Its true, I heare that the Miniſters of <hi>Stratz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg,</hi> and of the Church of <hi>Zurick,</hi> look as reverendly as the Proteſtant Church of England; and have ſet forth as exact a Confeſſion of their beliefe, as ye have done of yours in the 39. articles; but I could never learn that any of you had ſuch an Aſſembly as the Councell of <hi>Lateran,</hi> or of <hi>Trent.</hi> Therefore ye can not blame Catholicks to preferre the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of theſe Councells before the teſtimonies of the Church of <hi>Stratzburg, Zurick,</hi> or that of England, which was modeld (as our Prieſts tell us) by ſix Biſhops, and ſix other men, or the major part of them; ſeven of them were ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to caſt Chriſtian Religion, take away Sacraments, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the matter, and forme of them, and change the ancient ceremonies. Without doubt its more reaſonable to rely upon the Councell of <hi>Trent,</hi> then upon the twelve, or ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven perſons that invented the Common prayer Booke, and the Ritual of the Engliſh Church.</p>
                  <p n="17">17 <hi>Min.</hi> Haſt thou ever heard of one <hi>Fr. Paulo,</hi> who writ the Hiſtory of the Councell of <hi>Trent,</hi> and deſcribes how the holy Ghoſt was ſent in a bag thither from Rome? <hi>Cath.</hi> I have heard much of that man; they ſay he was no Saint, at leaſt of our Church, and had a ſpleene againſt the Pope. If what he writes, were true, not onely the Biſhops, and others who were in the Councell of <hi>Trent,</hi> had beene mad, or Impoſtors; but all the Catholicks of the world, who accepted the ſame as a true Councell, ought to be
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:106315:48"/>declared, and recorded naturall fooles. Its more credible that <hi>Fr. Paulo</hi> was a lying Knave, then that all the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks of the world are naturall fooles, or that all the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops of the Couuncell were Impoſtors. Therefore I can not believe his Hiſtory of the Councell of <hi>Trent.</hi> Truly his expreſſion of the holy Ghoſts journey in a bag, proves him to have been a profane fellow. They ſay his hiſtory is both ſolidly, and elegantly confuted by <hi>Palavicini</hi> the Jeſuite. Its ſtrange to me, how ſober Proteſtants can believe ſuch fopperies, and wicked practiſes of the chief Prelats, and perſons of the Catholick Church</p>
                  <p n="18">18 <hi>Min.</hi> Hold there friend. Doſt thou thinke that one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Roman Catholicks are the whole Catholick Church? ye are but a part. <hi>Cath.</hi> I am ſure Roman Catholick alone were the whole Catholick Church before that <hi>Luther,</hi> and <hi>Calvin</hi> begun their pretended Reformation. They, and all ye Proteſtants differ from us in Faith. Therefore ye are no part of the Catholick Church that was called ſo in the year 1516. If God hath Inſtituted another Catholick Church ſince, and ye make that appear. I am content to call ye Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks; but untill then, Maſter Doctor you muſt excuſe me. <hi>Min.</hi> Ye and we believe the ſame things, onely ye dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer from us in ſome petty matters, not neceſſary to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, as <hi>Tranſubſtantiation. Cath.</hi> Do you call that a petty thing, which the Catholick Church defined to be a matter of Faith? who ſhall be the Judge of what is neceſſary, or not neceſſary to be believed? <hi>Min.</hi> Not your Pope, nor his Councels, becauſe y are a part, and have a prejudice againſt our Doctrine. <hi>Cath.</hi> So have ye againſt ours, and by your conſequence ye muſt not judge of it. Ye are beſt be judged by the great Turke, if ye will not admit of the Pope to be Judge of Controverſies in Religion. Yet its not credible that God would have us be judged by Turkes, or Jewes. What thinke you Maſter Doctor? <hi>Min.</hi> But why ſhould the Pope, or Roman Church judge us Proteſtants, and we not judge them? <hi>Cath.</hi> Your Proteſtant Churches are not yet come to yeares of diſcretion. Our Church was in poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of judicature before yours was born: ye muſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce better evidence then we can ſhew, before you can ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally pretend to deprive us of what we poſſeſſed theſe 16. hundred yeares.</p>

<pb n="82" facs="tcp:106315:49"/>then thou art. <hi>Cath.</hi> Why do you ſay I am obſtinate? Is it becauſe I take not the word of your Engliſh Church (that is of 12. or 7. men) in matters of Faith, and Sacraments, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the teſtimony of all Catholick Councells, and the tradition of the whole Church? <hi>Min.</hi> I wonder that thou didſt not make mention of <hi>tradition</hi> before now. Woe to them that prefer the traditions of men before the Word of God! <hi>Cath.</hi> I do not take Scripture (as you interpret it) to be the Word of God Our Preachers teach us, that the Word of God muſt neceſſarily involve Gods meaning, and ſenſe. But ye Proteſtants intrude your own fancies, and dreames, and make them a part of Gods Word, rejecting the true ſenſe and meaning of Scripture, which the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church had learned of the Apoſtles, and preſerved from the firſt age of Chriſtianity to this preſent. <hi>Minist.</hi> What a calumny is this? Name but one fancy, or new in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation of ours intruded into Scripture. <hi>Cath.</hi> Do not ye ſay that the reſpect we give to Images is idolatry, or at leaſt forbidden in Scripture, as a thing inclining men to idolatry? The Catholick Church condemned long ſince this fancy of yours as hereſie: and ye make the common people believe, that we are idolaters for holding that ſenſe of Scripture, which hath been taught, and practiſed in the Church ſince the beginning, as learned men aſſure us, and they ſay the ſecond Councell of <hi>Nice</hi> do teſtifie.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XV. <hi>Of the difference between Chriſtian Faith, and the hiſtoricall beliefe of Proteſtants.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THat ſupernaturall Faith is a ſpeciall gift of God, is granted even by Proteſtants themſelves. The ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaturality
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:106315:50"/>of it conſiſts not in believing an extravagant, and improbable object; becauſe that may be done naturally. For there is nothing however ſo falſe, and improbable to the underſtanding, that will not at length be believed by men, if conſtantly reported to them by others of whom they have a good opinion, and not contradicted by any whoſe teſtimony they value. The Turks believe that <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet</hi> was a great Prophet, and Saint The Jews believe that the <hi>Meſſias</hi> is not yet come. The Puritans believe that every one of themſelves is inſpired with a Divine ſpirit &amp;c. And though every one of theſe ſtories be falſe, improba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and alſo contradicted by Catholicks, yet becauſe theſe Sectaries have a good opinion of their owne Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and a very bad one of us, Catholicks, they believe the firſt, reject, and contemne the ſecond. Turks, Jews, and Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritans do not believe theſe fond articles of their own Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion with any ſupernaturall Faith; their beliefe is meerly hiſtorical, juſt as children believe the hiſtory of the Knight in the Sunne, <hi>Don Quixote de la Manche</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>All Chriſtians have not ſupernaturall, and Chriſtian Faith. Many who received it in their Baptiſme, looſe it by hereſie. Hereticks are called Chriſtians, becauſe they are baptized, and not becauſe they are endued with Chriſtian beliefe. They believe ſome myſteries of Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, but with a meere hiſtoricall Faith They aſſent to the myſteries of the Trinity, and Incarnation, not becauſe God revealed them, but becauſe they are pleaſed to judge it ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry probable, or certain, that God revealed ſome ſuch thing. That their owne fancy, or opinion, and not Gods Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, doth move Proteſtants to believe what they do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve of Chriſtian Religion, is evident; becauſe they chooſe to themſelves amongſt all articles, which the Catholick Roman Church propoſed to the firſt Authors of Proteſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy <hi>Luther, Cranmer, Calvin, &amp;c.</hi> before the pretended Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, what they think fit, and moſt probable. All the reſt (though equally propoſed to them by the teſtimony of the ſaid Roman Church, as Divine Revelation) they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject as fabulous, or apocryphall, becauſe it ſuites not with their liberty, fancy, and manners.</p>
               <p>Hence it is that all Hereticks are damned by their owne proper judgement, and opinion; for he that makes choice of ſome articles, and rejects others, when all are equally te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:106315:50"/>to be revealed by God, doth not believe the very ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles he chooſeth becauſe God revealed them, but becau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe he is of opinion that God revealed them, and not the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers which he rejects; not regarding the teſtimony of the Church propoſing all equally as revealed A Jew believes that the <hi>Meſſias</hi> is not come, becauſe he thinks God revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Chriſt</hi> not to be the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> and yet his Faith is not ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaturall. Proteſtants therefore may believe what they pleaſe, becauſe they think God revealed it, and yet their Faith be neither Chriſtian, nor ſupernaturall: their owne perſuaſion alone, is not ſufficient <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> ſupernaturalize their beliefe. The difference between hiſtoricall, and Chriſtian, or ſupernaturall beliefe, is not, that Chriſtian beliefe alone hath for its object, ſupernaturall myſteries; (a man may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the myſtery of the Trinity, or Incarnation with as hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoricall a beliefe, as the hiſtory of <hi>Iulius Ceſar.</hi>) The diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence conſiſts in this, that the underſtanding doth meet with ſo great, and manifeſt difficulties, in crediting what is ſufficiently propoſed as Divine Revelation, to be really re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed, and true, that it may appear to any indifferent, and rationall man, God doth concurre more particularly to the aſſent of what is propoſed as Chriſtian Faith, then he doth to the aſſent we give ſtories, Chronicles or any other hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man hiſtory, though containing never ſo ſtrange and extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary events. To believe not onely ſtrange, and (to the ſenſe of man) improbable things, but alſo to believe them with a prudent beliefe (not out of ignorance, or miſinfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation) without the leaſt doubt, or ſuſpicion of falſhood, is ſo much above the way, and faculty of nature, that the Faith whereby this is done, muſt of neceſſity be an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary, and ſupernaturall gift of Gods omnipotency.</p>
               <p>Now let us examine, whether Proteſtants do ſo ſtraine their underſtanding by their beliefe (even of ſupernaturall myſteries) that it may be evidently called an extraordinary gift of Gods omnipotency? To be brief, I do ſay, that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants have no more ſupernaturall Faith in believing the Trinity, or Incarnation, &amp;c then in believing any ſtrange, or extraordinary accident that <hi>Iohn Stow</hi> recounts in his Chronicles: and conſequently, their Faith is meerly hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricall. My reaſon is this: Proteſtants believe as articles of Faith onely thoſe points wherein all Chriſtian, though he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticall Churches agree to be clearly contained in Scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:106315:51"/>or to be delivered by Tradition of the ſaid Churches. Whatſoever is controverted amongſt Chriſtians, they look upon it as not neceſſary to be believed. Its true moſt of them tell you, they believe the Apoſtles Creed; others co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me as far as Saint <hi>Athanaſius</hi> his Symbol; ſome are pleaſed to admit of the 4. firſt generall Councells. The motive of this their beliefe is not, becauſe the true Catholick Church teſtifieth that God revealed what they believe, but becauſe no Chriſtian Church, or Sect, wherewith they converſe, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>oth contradict any of theſe points. Such things as are contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted, or controverted by any, are not believed as articles of Faith If this be not meerly hiſtoricall, and human belief, there is none at all. What man is there, whether Turck, or Jew, that doth not believe after this manner, whatſoever is reported by many, and condicted by none whoſe authority hath any weight in his opinion? The reaſon why Turcks ſtick to their <hi>Alcoran,</hi> and the Jews to the Law of <hi>Moyſes,</hi> notwithſtanding all our contradictions, and teſtimonies, of the one being wicked, and the other aboliſhed, is, that they have a prejudice againſt us Chriſtians, they value not any thing we ſay in matters of Faith If Proteſtants had not the ſame prejudice, by their education, againſt Turcks, that Turcks have againſt Chriſtians, they would make the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church yet more univerſall then at the preſent they do: the <hi>Alcoran</hi> perhaps ſhould be part of the <hi>Bible;</hi> thoſe onely ſhould be articles of Faith wherein both agree; not onely all Hereticks, but Turcks ſhould be members, and part of the Catholick Church.</p>
               <p>Many are of opinion, that the liberty of life which Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants have (warrante by their new Religion) is the ſtrongeſt motive of their obſtinacy in it, and of propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the ſame. Though this be true in ſome perſons, it can not be applyed to all Proteſtants: ſome of them (give the Devil his due) have morality, and come near the old Pagan Philoſophers in their life, and converſation. But there is not one amongſt all the Proteſtants of the world, eſpecially of the Engliſh Church, or Common prayer men, that is not inveagled, and carried away with a liberty of believing onely that, as an article of Faith, which is not contradicted by any Chriſtian Congregation, or Church, however ſo different from his owne. Why ſhould Papiſts (ſaith every Proteſtant) impoſe unneceſſary articles of Faith upon us?
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:106315:51"/>why ſhould any one be obliged to believe what is not clear in Scripture? There is no liberty more earneſtly ſought after, then that of the underſtanding; all men are naturally taken with it; no captivity is more troubleſome then that of proper judgement: its impoſſible, without a ſupernaturall favour, and grace of God, to b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>dle the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination, and ordinary courſe of that faculty, which of its own nature is ſo curious, and vehement that it can not be quiet untill it knowes the reaſon of what we heare. To believe, is to captivate and confine the underſtanding to a dungeon of darkneſſe Not to believe, is to leave it at its own choice, and liberty; this laſt is naturall, and agreable to our inclination, and by conſequence is no proper effect of a ſupernaturall power. Its impoſſible therefore that it ſhould be Chriſtian Faith, or a ſupernaturall gift of God. In this ſenſe the way of heaven is ſtraight, becauſe Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, and not hiſtoricall beliefe, is the foundation, or firſt ſtep to ſalvation: we muſt force our ſelves to it by ſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our underſtanding to believe, and not give it liberty to accept, and reject what we pleaſe, making our ſelves Judges of all Controverſies concerning Scripture, and Chriſtian Religion. Let the negative articles of Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy be examined (as Proteſtants, they have no affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive) and we ſhall finde that nature, and not grace, leads them to that liberty which they aſſume to themſelves of ſhaking off not onely the yoke of interior acquieſcence, and exterior obedience to the decrees, &amp; definitions of the Catholick Roman Church; but alſo it will manifeſtly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, that Proteſtants, and all men are ſolicited by a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall propenſion to make our ſelves Scripture (as our ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves ſhall interpret it) or (which is the ſame) the Rule, or Judge of Controverſies. Therefore its no ſupernaturall action, nor no meritorious act, to believe after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, as Proteſtants do: for men have no difficulty in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving themſelves; and they believe themſelves, not God, when their own interpretation of Scripture is followed againſt that of the Church.</p>
               <p>It remaines now a reaſon be given, Why do Proteſtants believe the moſt obſcure, and difficult myſteries of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion, if their Faith be meerly hiſtoricall? How can they without a ſupernaturall power, and favour, belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve that the Scripture is Gods Word, the Trinity, the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:106315:52"/>of Incarnation, &amp;c.? To this doubt I anſwer, that (as I ſaid in the beginning of this Chapter) there is no diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty in believing the moſt improbable, and extravagant things, when they are told us by perſons we credit, and are not contradicted by any whoſe teſtimony we value. In matters of Religion Proteſtants value no men but Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, and ſuch myſteries as they believe, are not contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted by any Chriſtians, at leaſt in our parts of the world. They believe therefore all they believe, becauſe they have been told ſo by their Parents, and others who had the charge of inſtructing them; and not becauſe God revealed it, which is the onely motive of Chriſtian, and ſupernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Faith.</p>
               <p>Its a received principle, that he who denyes one article of Chriſtian Religion, believes none at all. It can not be ſaid that he believes none with hiſtoricall beliefe, as Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants believe the myſtery of the Trinity, Incarnation, and Scripture to be Gods Word. The meaning of all Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines is, that he who denyes one article of Faith, believes none at all with Chriſtian, or ſupernaturall beliefe. This is moſt true; for, to believe like a Chriſtian, is to believe the myſteries of Chriſtian Religion, becauſe they are ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently propoſed as Divine Revelation by the teſtimony of the Church; not of every Church, but of the true Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick one, which onely giveth lawfull authority, and ſends Preachers, and Doctors to inſtruct the people. God hath not promiſed his helpe, and ſupernaturall inſpi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions (which are neceſſary to believe with Chriſtian Faith) to them who are unſent, uncalled, unconſecrated, but onely to ſuch lawfull Miniſters as are appointed, and ordained by them who derive their Doctrine and ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion from the Apoſtles through a never interrupted line. That no Church but the Roman Catholick doth propoſe ſufficiently as Divine Revelation the Doctrine which they preach, hath been proved in the 8. Chapt. whence it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth, that out of the Roman Catholick Church there can be no true Faith, nor ſalvation; and that to deny one article of Faith in the leaſt matter, is to deny all; becauſe the motive of our beliefe is denyed as much in a little matter, as in the greateſt. See the 7. Chap. The motive being denyed, or rejected; nothing can be believed with Chriſtian Faith, becauſe of the motive depends all. An in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:106315:52"/>argument of denying the motive of Chriſtian Faith is, to contemne the teſtimony of that Congregation of men which hath the ſignes of being the true Catholick Church, as a legall, and orderly ſucceſſion of Doctors, and Doctrine, converſion of Nations, Miracles, and markes of ſo eminent, and extraordinary ſanctity of life, that the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke was never found in Heathen Philoſophers, but farre ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds all that hath beene diſcovered in any that wanted ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purnaturall grace, as is the entire renunciation of all the worldly pleaſure, profit, and honour; an inflamed af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection towards God, and his glory, with an unfatigable zeale of the ſalvation of ſoules, and deſire of ſuffering for <hi>Chriſts</hi> ſake, whereof we Catholicks alone have an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite number of undeniable examples. No other but the Roman Church can as much as pretend to have the ſignes of the true Church, as miracles remarkable either in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, or quality, &amp;c. Therefore whoſoever denyes one ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of the Roman Religion, denyth alſo the motive of Catholick Faith, which (as we have proved) is propoſed onely by the teſtimony of the Roman Catholick Church; and conſequently he who doth not ſtick to it, believes nothing at all with Chriſtian, and ſupernaturall Faith. The very Devils, and damned ſoules have the Proteſtant, or hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoricall beliefe. God, who is Author of all graces, and favours, both naturall, and ſupernaturall, grant to all Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants that pretious gift of Faith, without which it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to pleaſe His Divine Majeſty, or to obtaine the end whereunto we were all created.</p>
